"In this study, we introduce LSN-GAN, a new algorithm designed to improve [::Generative::] Adversarial Networks (GANs) by implementing Least Square Gradient Normalization. This technique adjusts gradients in the GAN&#39;s discriminator, making training more stable by avoiding common issues like gradient blow-up or disappearance. Our goal is to make GANs more reliable and enhance the quality of generate...","{'type': 'subscribed', 'message': 'Included in Your Digital Subscription'}",10674581,Tian Xia; Liyuan Liu,0,,,IEEE Conferences,10.1109/SEAI62072.2024.10674581,146,,,347,,,False,,,,,21-23 June 2024,2024 IEEE 4th International Conference on Software Engineering and [::Artificial::] [::Intelligence::] (SEAI),2024,IEEE,343,LSN -GAN: A Novel Least Square Gradient Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks,
"Wheat yield prediction is key to food security and optimal resource use. In this paper, [::Generative::] AI is use for specifically GANs and VAEs, to predict wheat yield under different weather conditions, uses the crop yield prediction dataset from Kaggle which has temperature, rainfall and soil quality as parameters and build models that beat traditional statistical methods.
