"This study develops an integrated framework, termed the GAI&amp;ABC model, to examine how manufacturing firms can leverage generative artificial intelligence (GAI) to achieve sustainable business model innovation (SBMI) in production systems. While prior research primarily focuses on the technical aspects of AI, we address the challenge of understanding the organisational learning mechanisms that underpin GAI's impact on SBMI. Drawing on the Antecedents-Behaviour-Consequences (ABC) model, we investigate the mediating roles of GAI-powered exploitative and exploratory learning, and consider international entrepreneurship orientation and GAI education as key moderators. Using survey data from 402 manufacturing start-ups in China and employing PLS-SEM analysis, we find that GAI adoption significantly enhances both exploitative learning (β = 0.439, p &lt; 0.001) and exploratory learning (β = 0.444, p &lt; 0.001), which in turn drive SBMI (β = 0.254 and β = 0.353, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, fsQCA reveals four distinct configurations of these factors that lead to high SBMI performance, highlighting the complexity of GAI implementation. This study contributes a novel theoretical framework that integrates GAI adoption with organisational learning and contextual factors to explain SBMI in production systems, offering actionable insights for firms and addressing the challenge of translating GAI's potential into tangible sustainability outcomes.","Wang, Shaofeng; Zhang, Hao",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/00207543.2025.2485318,kp66msknfb,,,18,International Journal of Production Research,,6757,6732,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=kp66msknfb&recordId=kp66msknfb&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250915,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Organizational learning; Business models; Flexible manufacturing systems; Manufacturing industries; China; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Learning by discovery; Machine learning,Leveraging generative artificial intelligence for sustainable business model innovation in production systems.,63
"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools based on large language models are quickly reshaping how researchers conduct surveys and experiments. From reviewing the literature and designing instruments to administering studies, coding data, and interpreting results, these tools offer substantial opportunities to improve research productivity and advance methodology. Yet with this potential comes a critical challenge: Researchers often use these systems without fully understanding how they work. This article aims to provide a practical guide for effective and responsible GenAI use in primary research. The authors begin by explaining how GenAI systems operate, highlighting the gap between their intuitive interfaces and the underlying model architectures. They then examine different use cases throughout the research process, noting both the opportunities and associated risks at each stage. Throughout this review, the authors provide flexible tips for best practice and rules for effective and responsible GenAI use, particularly in areas pertaining to ensuring the validity of GenAI-coding of unstructured data (i.e., open-ended responses). The hope is that these guidelines will help researchers integrate GenAI into their workflows in a transparent, rigorous, and ethically sound manner. An accompanying website (https://questionableresearch.ai) provides supporting materials, including reproducible coding templates in R and SPSS and sample preregistrations.","Blanchard, Simon J.; Duani, Nofar; Garvey, Aaron M.; Netzer, Oded; Oh, Travis Tae",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/00222429251349882,kpi7sx3lo5,,,6,Journal of Marketing,,139,119,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=kpi7sx3lo5&recordId=kpi7sx3lo5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251101,American Marketing Association,Best practices; Computer systems design and related services (except video game design and development); <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Surveys; Experiments; Research methodology; Software architecture; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> &amp; ethics; Language models,"New Tools, New Rules: A Practical Guide to Effective and Responsible Generative AI Use for Surveys and Experiments in Research.",89
"The use of generative AI (genAI) in consumer research is rapidly evolving, with applications including synthetic data generation, data analysis, and more. However, their role in creative ideation—a cornerstone of consumer research— remains underexplored. Drawing on the human creativity literature, we propose that ideation with genAI is facilitated by its productivity and semantic breadth, which are psychologically analogous to the dual pathways of persistence and flexibility in human ideation. Further, we distinguish between the utility of genAI as a key ideator versus humans as key ideator, conceptualized through the genAI ideation roles of Designer and Writer and of Interviewer and Actor. While genAI excels in generating incremental improvements, its potential for groundbreaking innovation could be unlocked by leveraging its ability to prompt human creativity. This article advances the theoretical and practical understanding of genAI in ideation for consumer research, offering numerous practical guidelines for integrating generative AI into research while emphasizing human–AI collaboration to achieve radical insights.","Freitas, Julian De; Nave, Gideon; Puntoni, Stefano",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1093/jcr/ucaf012,twe2fmolb5,,,1,Journal of Consumer Research,,31,18,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=twe2fmolb5&recordId=twe2fmolb5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Oxford University Press / USA,Consumer research; Production (Economic theory); Idea (Philosophy); <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language models; Creative ability; Human-<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> interaction; Semantics,Ideation with Generative AI—in Consumer Research and Beyond.,52
"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has introduced new possibilities for both the creation and analysis of language, which is one key input for consumer culture researchers who analyze qualitative and textual data. How can consumer culture researchers use GenAI to produce insights and work with qualitative data? What are the possibilities and challenges of using these tools? And what are some valuable practices and principles for integrating GenAI into the research process? Building from interviews with researchers who use these tools, the authors identify relevant theoretical, embodied, empirical, and historical contextual dimensions that produce opportunities and challenges for human–AI collaboration.

"This essay in honor of ASQ 's 70th volume surveys how technology-driven changes in scholarly publishing have introduced algorithmic management to organizational research. The internet greatly reduced the cost of publishing journals and prompted an orders-of-magnitude increase in the number of journals and articles while also foregrounding quantitative metrics for scholarship. Given the academic incentive system of publish or perish, the new online ecosystem has encouraged problematic practices by scholars and publishers that threaten the standards and values of organizational theory. The advent of generative artificial intelligence within this milieu is almost certain to worsen the publishing trends we have already experienced. Drawing on prior literature about the centrality of deep intellectual engagement through reading, writing, and interactions with colleagues, we propose a set of reforms to preserve the sacredness of craft and community at the core of our scholarly work.","Bechky, Beth A.; Davis, Gerald F.",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/00018392241304403,ozaeuwiezj,,,1,Administrative Science Quarterly,,22,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=ozaeuwiezj&recordId=ozaeuwiezj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250301,Administrative Science Quarterly,Organizational research; Technological innovations; Book Publishers; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Scholarly publishing; Bibliometrics; Philosophy of science,Resisting the Algorithmic Management of Science: Craft and Community After Generative AI.,70

"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represents a watershed moment in the evolution of digital platforms. The capabilities of this AI technology go beyond traditional AI systems, enabling the autonomous generation of novel outcomes with significant implications for platform value creation, architecture, governance, and stakeholder interactions. We develop an integrative conceptual framework that identifies four key mechanisms through which GenAI transforms digital platforms: intelligent automation, democratization, hyper-personalization, and collaborative innovation. Through intelligent automation, GenAI transforms boundary resources from passive interfaces into active, intelligent mediators of value creation. Democratization systematically lowers barriers to platform participation. Hyper-personalization enables dynamic, individual-level adaptation of platform content. Collaborative innovation transforms platform innovation by making GenAI an active participant in human-AI value co-creation. We use this framework to situate the papers in the special issue and develop a research agenda that explores the transformative impact of GenAI on platform stakeholder relationships.","Wessel, Michael; Adam, Martin; Benlian, Alexander; Majchrzak, Ann; Thies, Ferdinand",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487315,n7hrc4sanf,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,369,346,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=n7hrc4sanf&recordId=n7hrc4sanf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Value creation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language models; Digital technology,Generative AI and its Transformative Value for Digital Platforms.,42
"Compared to traditional digital technologies, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) exhibits two facets—open-endedness and inscrutability—that create challenges for the value co-creation of complementors in GenAI platform ecosystems. For example, complementors lack standardized, reusable functionality that powers their applications and struggle to consistently generate desired outputs. To identify how complementors mitigate these challenges, we conducted an embedded case study of complementors in the OpenAI platform ecosystem. We identified four value co-creation mechanisms of embedded and stand-alone complements that mitigate the challenges: (1) utilizing system instructions, (2) providing context data, (3) curating user inputs, and (4) revising AI model outputs. Depending on the complement type, complementors employ these mechanisms, leverage synergies between mechanisms, and unlock previously not employable mechanisms. We contribute to research by revealing two novel logics—the reap logic and the differentiation logic—that explain how complementors co-create value by mitigating the challenges through the value co-creation mechanisms.","Heimburg, Vincent; Schreieck, Maximilian; Wiesche, Manuel",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487310,pyb32jbbjz,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,528,491,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=pyb32jbbjz&recordId=pyb32jbbjz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Customer cocreation; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Value creation; Marketing Consulting Services; Marketing Research and Public Opinion Polling; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language models,Complementor Value Co-Creation in Generative AI Platform Ecosystems.,42
"Incorporating intelligent robotics into STEM education enhances students’ knowledge proficiency and higher-order thinking. In the era of big data, students must possess strong data literacy and visualization skills. However, students often struggle to understand and apply data effectively. This study developed an Intelligent Inquiry-Based Learning Companion System utilizing Generative AI (GenAI) to address these challenges and improve data visualization literacy among graduate students. The study involved 53 graduate students from a university in northern Taiwan, enrolled in an 18-week course. The experimental group used the Intelligent Inquiry-Based Learning Companion System, while the control group used a general ChatGPT for their interactions. The students interacted with an AI, which supported their inquiry-based learning through interactive conversations. The results indicate that students become more confident in interpreting complex material sets after using the Intelligent Inquiry-Based Learning Companion System. Students also find it easier to share their findings with classmates. The inquiry-based learning companion system enhances organizational strategies and critical thinking, although it has a limited impact on metacognitive self-regulation, peer learning, and help-seeking behaviors. The system completed the coursework, although some users reported issues with more complicated, open-ended tasks that required further assistance from humans to complete them properly. It enabled students to dive into a more specific set of questions. In addition, students mentioned that immediate, customized responses and dashboards can enrich their learning experience.","Hung, Hui-Chun; Lai, Pei-Jhou",JSTOR Journals,,,wv4ui4gtcb,,,4,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,320,304,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=wv4ui4gtcb&recordId=oeuz4akfiz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251001,,,Enhancing graduate students’ data visualization literacy through an inquiry-based learning companion system integrated with generative AI,28
"Generative AI (GenAI) may fundamentally reshape how users seek knowledge in online knowledge sharing communities. Although prior work found an overall decrease in knowledge seeking in online communities upon the availability of GenAI, the underlying dynamics across user groups have remained unexplored. This study addresses that gap. Drawing on commitment-based theory, we hypothesize that casual users—motivated by cost-benefit considerations—are more likely to reduce their question-posting activity than highly committed members. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that ChatGPT's arrival leads to a substantial drop in questions on StackExchange, primarily driven by casual users (about 18.2%). Motivated by information foraging theory, we reveal heterogeneous downstream effects of GenAI on question characteristics. In particular, we find that the questions by casual users become more complex and novel, while those by intensive and top users do not. These results highlight the importance of heterogeneous user motivations in shaping platform dynamics, underscoring that while GenAI may diminish overall participation, it may also increase the value of the remaining content. Our study offers insights for knowledge sharing communities, managers, and stakeholders reliant on user-generated data, providing a nuanced view of GenAI's disruptive influence.","Quinn, Martin; Gutt, Dominik",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487313,66zjegq6hj,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,399,370,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=66zjegq6hj&recordId=66zjegq6hj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Information theory; Information sharing; Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Theory of knowledge; ChatGPT; Virtual communities,Heterogeneous Effects of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on Knowledge Seeking in Online Communities.,42
"Digital platforms facilitate interactions among geographically distributed users which reinforce the positive network effects. However, a disproportionate increase in the contributions of users results in contribution pollution (disproportionate increase in users' contributions) and information cacophony (incoherence of contributions). Unaddressed, contribution pollution and information cacophony challenges have negative implications for platform efficiency and users' humanistic outcomes. This paper highlights the limitations of existing mechanisms and proposes a framework for a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)–based recommender system. To evaluate the efficacy of the GenAI–based recommender system, we develop an agent-based simulation model and conduct experiments using real data from three platforms (Reddit, Hacker News, and Stack Overflow). This research contributes a novel sociotechnical framework that addresses the challenges of contribution pollution and information cacophony. For the governance of platforms, this research provides actionable guidance on the policy implications of integrating GenAI-based technologies for user- and platform-level outcomes.","Malgonde, Onkar S.",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487311,dlomzcrj5v,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,490,457,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=dlomzcrj5v&recordId=dlomzcrj5v&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Recommender systems; Information networks; Pollution; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Digital technology,Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)-Based Recommender Addressing Contribution Pollution and Information Cacophony on Digital Platforms.,42
"As STEM education evolves to meet the demands of the 21st century, fostering creativity and problem-solving skills has become a critical objective. This study examines how learners approach STEM problems requiring creative thinking with generative AI (GenAI). The research explores two key questions: (a) How do students engage in the creative problem solving (CPS) process using GenAI across social and scientific problem domains? (b) What differences exist between high- and low-performing students in using prompts during CPS with GenAI? The study involved 38 middle school students (aged 15) in Korea, who solved social and scientific problems from the PISA 2022 Creative Thinking Assessment using ChatGPT. The findings revealed distinct patterns in students’ use of GenAI, varying by problem domain and performance level. In the social problem domain, students primarily relied on ChatGPT’s suggestions, frequently using prompts to request fully developed solutions or elaboration on ChatGPT’s ideas. In contrast, in the scientific problem domain, students developed problem solving strategies around their ideas and integrated ChatGPT’s suggestions in a more balanced way. A detailed analysis of prompt strategies revealed prominent differences between high- and low-performing students. High-performing students used diverse prompt types and strategically combined them with their own insights. In contrast, low-performing students relied heavily on ChatGPT’s suggestions with minimal modification or originality. This study contributes to understanding how learners engage with GenAI for CPS across different domains and provides implications for designing educational strategies that equip learners to utilize GenAI effectively for CPS in STEM education.","Lee, Chohui; So, Hyo-Jeong",JSTOR Journals,,,7ujlj535qn,,,4,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,258,241,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=7ujlj535qn&recordId=l352du2e7z&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251001,,,Learners leveraging generative AI for creative problem solving : Focusing on the PISA 2022 creative thinking problems,28
"While digital platform vendors are rapidly offering new generative artificial intelligence products (GAIPs), prior research on algorithmic aversion suggests that users may not respond to them the same way as to the human-generated products (HGPs). We propose that GAIPs induce psychological value, defined as a user's intrinsic desire for a product that can influence their willingness to pay and may depend on the product type. Disclosing a product as a GAIP or HGP could further influence user reactions. From our randomized experiments with three different products representing functional, hybrid, and creative product types, we find psychological value plays an important role in creative products, such as wall art. Human disclosure shows no effect on functional or highly creative products. Our study theoretically extends the algorithmic aversion literature by illustrating the role of psychological value in GAIP highlighting the nuanced role of product type and disclosure in influencing user reactions and offering practical implications.","Sikhondze, Bachazile; Ye, Hua Jonathan; Wang, Weiyu; Zhan, Xinhui; Santhanam, Radhika",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/07421222.2025.2487314,2wvkvdd4b5,,,2,Journal of Management Information Systems,,456,431,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=2wvkvdd4b5&recordId=2wvkvdd4b5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Willingness to pay; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Street art; Digital technology; Aversion,Are You Willing to Pay for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Products?

"Digital platforms are increasingly integrating Generative AI (GenAI) tools as a boundary resource to enhance the quantity and quality of content with the ultimate goal of improving platform viability. As GenAI tools hold unique characteristics compared to traditional boundary resources, platform owners need to adapt their governance mechanisms accordingly. To understand how platform governance evolves over time in response to this novel boundary resource, we draw on the distributed tuning framework and build on insights from an in-depth qualitative study of a digital content platform in the educational sector. We find that the platform owner deployed different logics of GenAI integration over time that were enacted through specific governance mechanisms. The shift in logics and respective governance mechanisms was triggered by a dialectic process of resistance and accommodation between platform actors. In this process, the GenAI-enabled boundary resource not only changed over time but also served as a means for the power dynamics between platform owner and complementors to be reshaped.

"The rapid progress of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked growing concerns regarding its misuse, privacy risks, and ethical issues. This study investigates the interplay between Generative AI Abuse Anxiety, trust, perceived usefulness, acceptance, and the intention to use it. Using variance-based partial least squares (PLS-SEM), we analyze 318 valid survey responses. The findings reveal that Generative AI Abuse Anxiety negatively impacts trust, perceived usefulness, acceptance, and the intention to use generative AI. Additionally, different subdimensions of trust play significant roles in influencing users' technology acceptance and intention to use it, though the specific mechanisms differ.

"This paper studies the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on the demand for online freelancers using a large data set from a leading global freelancing platform. We identify the types of jobs that are more affected by generative AI and quantify the magnitude of the heterogeneous impact. Our findings indicate a 21% decrease in the number of job posts for automation-prone jobs related to writing and coding compared with jobs requiring manual-intensive skills within eight months after the introduction of ChatGPT. We show that the reduction in the number of job posts increases competition among freelancers, whereas the remaining automation-prone jobs are of greater complexity and offer higher pay. We also find that the introduction of image-generating AI technologies led to a 17% decrease in the number of job posts related to image creation. We use Google Trends to show that the more pronounced decline in the demand for freelancers within automation-prone jobs correlates with their higher public awareness of ChatGPT's substitutability.

"Global supply chains are increasingly exposed to disruptions from pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, and environmental shocks, challenging traditional resilience models. Existing approaches often rely on structured historical data and static assumptions, making them insufficient in contexts with unstructured signals, rapid shifts, and heterogeneous data quality. To address these gaps, this study proposes UNISONE, a Generative AI (GAI)–driven resilience framework integrating disruption sensing, probabilistic state modelling, and adaptive optimisation. The framework has three modules: a GAI component that processes unstructured data into validated signals; a Markov modelling layer that translates signals into probabilistic transitions of capacity, logistics, and policy states; and a Mixed Integer Programming optimisation module that dynamically reallocates resources. This integration enables proactive risk detection, real-time capacity adjustment, and rapid supply chain reconfiguration. Empirical analysis using data from three global regions shows UNISONE sustains service continuity above 90% under disruptions, reduces cost volatility by nearly 20% versus baseline models, and accelerates recovery across cycles. Findings also reveal how data quality and digital readiness shape performance, offering phased adoption insights for industries such as pharmaceuticals, food, and semiconductors. By combining unstructured signal processing, probabilistic modelling, and adaptive optimisation, UNISONE framework advances both theory and practice in supply chain resilience.","Lin, Kuo-Yi; Wu, Shih-Yu; Matsuno, Kotomichi",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/00207543.2025.2574412,zy6wbgx4ir,,,,International Journal of Production Research,,26,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=zy6wbgx4ir&recordId=zy6wbgx4ir&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251015,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Supply chain management; Organizational resilience; Capacity requirements planning; Stochastic models; Resource allocation; Data quality; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>,Generative AI-Driven resilience in supply chain management: UNISONE framework for disruption modelling and capacity optimisation.,

"This study investigates the short-term impact of generative AI, exemplified by the introduction of ChatGPT, on user contributions in a coding Q&amp;A platform. We find that the introduction of ChatGPT led to a reduction in the number of high-quality answers provided by users, particularly among highly engaged contributors, despite an overall increase in answers. We identify two key mechanisms: (1) increased perceived question sophistication despite no actual change in content and (2) reduced motivation of loyal users in providing answers in the face of AI-generated alternatives. The findings suggest that while generative AI can facilitate value creation on user-generated content (UGC) platforms, it also poses challenges in retaining core contributors and managing content quality. The paper contributes to the literature on the impact of AI adoption on platforms and suggests practical implications for UGC platform management, such as the need for AI content disclosure measures to retain engaged users.","Li, Xinyu; Kim, Keongtae",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1007/s11002-024-09747-1,onayklj53f,,,3,Marketing Letters,,591,577,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=onayklj53f&recordId=onayklj53f&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250901,Springer Nature,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; User-generated content; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; ChatGPT; Question &amp; answer websites,Impacts of generative AI on user contributions: evidence from a coding Q &amp;A platform.,36

This study explores the challenges and benefits of adopting AI-driven content creation tools. The analytical method used is holistic coding. Findings/results: The results reveal that Generative AI significantly enhances content production in terms of creativity, relevance, and efficiency, while also improving audience engagement and brand visibility. These findings confirm that in content creation, it is no longer necessary to pay third parties to create content, and women entrepreneurs can automatically generate the marketing content they need at no cost. Furthermore, this study highlights how AI acts as a powerful catalyst for social and economic empowerment by providing micro-businesses with the tools necessary to compete in the digital economy. Conclusion: The research findings emphasize the transformative potential of AI in reshaping traditional marketing approaches, fostering greater inclusivity and growth in the entrepreneurial landscape. Although these entities have implemented generative AI technologies to augment the production of marketing materials, they are currently lack the specialized competency in prompt composition required to optimize the conversion potential of the resulting content for marketing purposes. Through its relevant institutions, the government is strategically promoting digital transformation by establishing dedicated digital and AI learning centers in some regions. According to the informants, however, these initiatives seldom reach female-owned micro-businesses in those same regions. Originality/value: By shedding light on the specific impact of AI on women microentrepreneurs, this study contributes to the broader discourse on gender, entrepreneurship, and technological innovation. The implications of this research offer valuable insights for policymakers, business practitioners, and stakeholders aiming to support the digital transformation of women-led micro-enterprises.","Abdul Ghonisyah, Ghaling Achmad; Asyiah, <mark>Ai</mark> Kusmiati",Business Source Ultimate,,10.17358/IJBE.11.3.724,tnq55eoiob,,,3,Indonesian Journal of Business &amp; Entrepreunership,,733,724,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=tnq55eoiob&recordId=tnq55eoiob&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250901,IPB University,Content marketing; Businesswomen; Digital transformation; Qualitative research; Entrepreneurship; Indonesia; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Indonesians; Capacity building,THE AMPLIFICATION OF GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) IN CONTENT MARKETING FOR WOMEN MICRO-ENTREPRENEURS: QUALITATIVE CASE STUDY APPROACH.,11
"Teachers’ instructional decisions rely on effective data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers flexible and efficient support for these processes. However, few studies have explored its practical application in classroom decision-making. This study aimed to develop a generative AI chatbot to enhance teachers’ data literacy (DL) and data-informed decision-making (DIDM). Using Richey and Klein’s design and development research methodology, this study was conducted in four phases: analysis, design, development, and evaluation. The chatbot was reviewed by five experts and pilot-tested by four participants before being tested in an experiment. A single group pre-post paired samples t-test was conducted with 25 teachers, who interacted with the chatbot on Zoom once a week for 2 weeks. Teachers’ reflective journals were examined using open coding procedures to analyze their responses. The findings revealed a significant increase in teachers’ DL and DIDM efficacy. A qualitative analysis of the teachers’ reflective journals highlighted the chatbot’s strengths, limitations, and potential improvements. Based on these findings, this study offers practical implications for developing and using generative AI chatbots to support school teachers’ DIDM processes.","Lee, Jiwon; Lee, Jeongmin",JSTOR Journals,,,ddi7twzuw5,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,317,298,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=ddi7twzuw5&recordId=bxmxejfcbr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,Generative AI chatbot for teachers’ data-informed decision-making : Effects and insights,28
"The emergence of Generative AI technologies, represented by ChatGPT, has triggered extensive discussions among scholars in the education sector. While relevant research continues to grow, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding that systematically measures the effects of Generative AI on student learning outcomes. This study employs meta-analysis to integrate findings from previous experimental and quasi-experimental research to evaluate the impact of Generative AI on student learning outcomes. The analysis of 44 effect sizes from 21 independent studies indicates that Generative AI tools, compared to traditional AI tools or no intervention, moderately enhance student learning outcomes ( g = 0.572). These tools significantly improve the cognitive ( g = 0.604), behavioral ( g = 0.698), and affective ( g = 0.478) dimensions of learning outcomes. In addition, the study identifies and examines 6 potential moderating variables: educational level, sample size, subject area, teaching model, intervention duration, and assessment instrument. The results of the moderating effects test reveal that sample size and assessment instrument significantly influence the effectiveness of Generative AI. For sample size, the effect of Generative AI on small samples ( g = 1.216) is greater than that on medium ( g = 0.476) and large samples ( g = 0.547). For assessment instrument, the effect of Generative AI on self-developed tests ( g = 0.984) is greater than that on standardized tests ( g = 0.557). The meta-analysis result indicated that the use of Generative AI should be supplemented with detailed guidance and flexible strategies. Specific recommendations for future research and practical implementations of Generative AI in education are discussed.","Hu, De-Xin; Pang, Dan-Dan; Xing, Zhe",JSTOR Journals,,,eaf6cdzfon,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,240,226,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=eaf6cdzfon&recordId=rmo65ntrgb&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,Evaluating the effects of Generative AI on student learning outcomes : Insights from a meta-analysis,28
"For the past several years, internal audit functions (IAFs) have been significantly increasing their digitization efforts to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the IAF. The introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT has increased the potential for IAFs to have a more significant impact; however, there is little guidance on how ChatGPT or other generative AI (GenAI) tools can influence the day-to-day work of internal auditors. This paper demonstrates with specific examples how GenAI can be used to enhance all aspects of the audit process for a broad variety of IAFs. Although not comprehensive in nature, the detailed, illustrative examples should help internal auditors see actionable steps they can take to be more efficient and effective and thus add more value to their organizations.

"In 2025, National Literacy Trust wanted to increase their understanding of how generative AI tools might be beginning to influence what it means to be literate in the digital age. National Literacy Trust first asked children and young people about their awareness and use of generative AI platforms in their Annual Literacy Survey in early 2023, shortly after the launch of ChatGPT-3 in late 2022. Since that time, many more generative AI tools have emerged, and National Literacy Trust included a broader range of questions on AI in the Annual Literacy Survey in early 2024. The first report, published in the summer of 2024, noted a rapid increase in awareness and use of generative AI tools over the previous year, as well as varying attitudes towards their use. For example, while 2 in 5 young people said they added their own thoughts to AI outputs in 2024, 1 in 5 admitted that they did not check these outputs in case they were wrong. Teacher surveys at the time also presented a mixed picture, with many teachers open to the potential of generative AI for supporting aspects of literacy (such as modelling good writing) but with others concerned about potential negative impacts of these tools on young people's critical thinking and engagement with learning. In 2025, National Literacy Trust wanted to deepen understanding of how generative AI tools might influence what it means to be literate in the digital age. This report builds on the initial findings by looking in more depth at how young people might be using AI to support different aspects of the writing and reading process, as well as asking young people about their attitudes and behaviours when using these tools, and their perceptions of the value of learning to write in the age of AI.",Irene Picton; Christina Clark; Francesca Bonafede; National Literacy Trust (United Kingdom),ERIC,,,5ok6wbg3dz,,,,National Literacy Trust,,,,,False,20250801,,Foreign Countries; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Literacy Education; Digital Literacy; Writing Processes; Student Attitudes; Student Behavior; Adolescents; Student Motivation; Educational Trends; Technology Uses in Education; Student Surveys; United Kingdom,Young People's Use of Generative AI to Support Literacy in 2025,
"This report aims to update and broaden the understanding of teachers' experiences of teaching reading and writing as the capabilities of generative AI expand and improve. As part of ongoing research considering what it means to be literate in the digital age, the National Literacy Trust have been exploring how generative AI tools might influence, or even redefine, literacy since early 2023. The first reports, published in the summer of 2024, used data from National Literacy Trust's Annual Literacy Survey to explore children, young people and teachers' attitudes and behaviour around using AI to support literacy. This report builds on earlier findings by looking in more detail at teachers' use of AI to support writing and reading, while also exploring frontline perspectives on the benefits and drawbacks of generative AI for literacy to guide future work in this area. When ChatGPT-3 launched in late 2022, early projections around the impact of generative AI focused more on its potential to boost young people's academic progress (such as through more personalised and adaptive learning) than how it might support teachers. More recently (and perhaps reflecting broader concerns around 'screen time'), the discourse has become more nuanced. In early 2025, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson suggested that, in an educational context, AI was ""… less about how children and young people use technology, and more about how we support staff to use it to deliver a better education for children"". Against a background of these wider debates, in 2025 findings show that the gap between teachers' and young people's use of generative AI has narrowed, although more young people still report using these tools than those who educate them. At the same time, findings indicate increasing concerns about young people's use of AI, from academic integrity to perceptions of the value of developing writing and reading skills in the age of AI.",I.

"Distributed AI workflows deployed across cloud-agnostic environments face frequent anomalies and failures, yet existing monitoring approaches remain largely reactive issuing alerts only after performance degrades and relying on static recovery rules that fail to adapt to dynamic workload fluctuations. This lack of proactive, intelligent recovery leads to prolonged downtime, inefficient resource utilization, and higher operational costs. To overcome these shortcomings, this research introduces a self-healing monitoring framework that integrates generative AI at every stage of anomaly management. The framework detects irregularities before they escalate, forecasts resource demands, and automatically executes remediation policies such as service scaling, restarts, or rollbacks. Architected using microservices and containerized deployment, the system combines statistical anomaly detection with generative diagnostics for root-cause analysis and actionable recovery planning. In experimental evaluations with benchmark AI pipelines, the proposed framework improved detection precision by 25%, reduced mean recovery time by 40%, and enhanced resource utilization by up to 30%, all while sustaining high throughput under variable loads. These outcomes confirm that embedding generative intelligence transforms monitoring from a passive observer into an active, resilient guardian of distributed AI workflows.","Vinoth Kumar, K; Barakkath Nisha, U; Yasir Abdullah, R",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICESC65114.2025.11212528,2cuoep4rf5,,,,"2025 6th International Conference on Electronics and Sustainable Communication Systems (ICESC), Electronics and Sustainable Communication Systems (ICESC), 2025 6th International Conference on",,2085,2080,,True,20250910,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Robotics and Control Systems; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Pipelines; Transforms; Observers; Throughput; Planning; Resource management; Monitoring; Anomaly detection; Optimization; anomaly detection; automated recovery; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; resource optimization; self-healing; workflow monitoring",Autonomous Recovery and Monitoring in AI Workflows with Generative AI,
"With the start of generative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to create ads at scale, is the industry in danger of creating ineffective content efficiently, or AI can help achieve both efficiency and effectiveness? The adoption of generative AI in advertising is a function of not only efficiency but also effectiveness gains. This study looks beyond efficiency to consider consumer responses. It explores the productivity of AI-powered ads, in which generative AI tools assist in specific creative tasks under human supervision. This study introduces a new measure of artificial intelligence advertising productivity (AAP). This measure employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) to examine the balance of generative AI advertising specific inputs to consumer response outputs. To understand consumer responses, this study uses topic modeling (BERTopic) and sentiment analysis (Google Natural Language AI) to analyze 10,378 consumer comments on the generative AI-powered ads and their comparable human-created ads. The results are fed into DEA to calculate AAP. The AAP measure provides marketers a suggested metric to evaluate the value gained from their AI advertising initiatives. It provides brands with a benchmark to assess their AI advertising performance against other brands. The results show a majority of generative AI-powered ads in the sample were identified as productive and consumers generally perceive these ads positive.","Yang, Jing",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/15252019.2025.2551598,a2rpar2ywr,,,3,Journal of Interactive Advertising,,239,222,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=a2rpar2ywr&recordId=a2rpar2ywr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250901,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Advertising; Sentiment analysis; Value (Economics); Industrial productivity; Advertising effectiveness; Consumer behavior; Other Services Related to Advertising; Outdoor Advertising; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Data envelopment analysis,Exploring the Productivity of Generative AI-Powered Ad Campaigns: A Consumer Response Perspective.,25
"Previous studies have demonstrated that summarization activities effectively enhance students’ reading comprehension and learning performance. With the ongoing surge in the application of artificial intelligence in education, this study introduces a chatbot with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to assist students in reviewing Python programming concepts by refining the summary after class. Consequently, this study aims to assess the efficacy of the proposed a GenAI-enabled chatbot in enhancing the summarization ability and learning performance of novice programmers in college. Experimental results reveal that, the GenAI-enabled chatbot not only significantly improves students’ programming coding performance but also significantly improves their summarization ability. It is noteworthy that students’ summarization proficiency is not only elevated from the outset but also consistently progresses until the end. This study also identified that understanding the Python programming concepts of input/output operations and lists serves as predictors for learning performance in programming concept and coding, respectively. This emphasizes the significance of fundamental programming concept and a nuanced understanding of advanced data types in programming learning.","Huang, Anna Y.

"ChatGPT, which rides on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has garnered exponential attention worldwide since its release in 2022. While there is an increasing number of studies probing into the potential benefits and challenges of ChatGPT in education, most of them confine the focus to informal learning and higher education. The formal adoption of ChatGPT in authentic classroom settings, especially in K-12 contexts, remains underexplored. In view of this gap, we conducted a quasi-experiment to study the effects of integrating ChatGPT into a compulsory Grade-10 English as a foreign language (EFL) writing course in a Hong Kong secondary school. The participants (99 Grade-10 students) were divided into treatment or control groups; the former and latter respectively used ChatGPT and conventional media as the tool for EFL writing instruction. The analysis of the participants’ EFL writing performance at the end of the experiment shows that the treatment group outperformed the control group. Further, there was a significant interaction effect between the assigned group of participants and their baseline level of EFL proficiency. Compared to the high-achieving participants, low-achieving ones tended to benefit more from ChatGPT-supported EFL writing instruction in the experiment. These findings together suggest that ChatGPT has the potential to be applied in formal EFL writing instruction in K-12 classroom settings.","Pei, Leisi; Jong, Morris Siu-Yung; Huang, Biyun; Pang, Wai-Chung; Shang, Junjie",JSTOR Journals,,,7lnubspiuf,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,297,281,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=7lnubspiuf&recordId=5446jp46db&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,Formally integrating Generative AI into secondary education : Application of ChatGPT in EFL writing instruction,28
"Language teachers mostly spend much time scoring students’ writing and may sometimes hesitate to provide reliable scores since essay scoring is time-consuming. In this regard, AI-based Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems have been used and Generative AI (GenAI) has recently appeared with its potential in scoring essays. Therefore, this study aims to focus on the differences and relationships between human raters (HR) and GenAI scores for the essays produced by English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. The data consisted of 210 essays produced by 35 undergraduate students. Two HR and GenAI evaluated the essays using an analytical rubric divided into the following five factors: (1) ideas, (2) organization and coherence, (3) support, (4) style, and (5) mechanics. This study found that there were significant differences between the scores given by HR and those generated by GenAI, as well as variations among the HR themselves; nonetheless, GenAI’s scores were similar across dual evaluations. It was also noted that GenAI’s scores were statistically significantly lower than those of HR. On the other side, it was found that HR scores correlated weakly, while GenAI scores correlated strongly. A significant correlation was observed between HR-1 and GenAI across all factors, whereas the second HR-2 showed significant correlations with GenAI in only three factors. Therefore, this study can guide EFL teachers on how to reduce their workload in writing assessments by giving GenAI more responsibility in scoring essays. The study also offers many suggestions for future studies on AES based on the findings and limitations of the study.","Topuz, Arif Cem; Yıldız, Mine; Taşlıbeyaz, Elif; Polat, Hamza; Kurşun, Engin",JSTOR Journals,,,mmozmdabav,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,50,36,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=mmozmdabav&recordId=jzhfcwvfdn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,Is generative AI ready to replace human raters in scoring EFL writing?

"AbstractAdvertising research widely uses visual stimuli. Stimuli development, whether by researchers or by hired designers, requires considerable time, funding, and know-how. Image generative artificial intelligence (iGenAI) allows faster and more cost-effective stimuli production, but whether this technology can produce rigorous experimental stimuli comparable to researcher-generated stimuli remains an open question addressed herein. First, we review publications in three advertising and marketing journals to identify relevant domains where iGenAI can be applied.

Five studies (1,785 participants) directly compare visual stimuli generated using RAISE and iGenAI to stimuli generated by researchers and show that participants cannot differentiate them. Moreover, AI-generated stimuli satisfy the same manipulation checks in and replicate the effects of existing research. Three additional studies (&lt;italic&gt;N&lt;/italic&gt; = 368) lend additional robustness, indicating that iGenAI and RAISE are valuable tools to complement traditional methods for producing visual experimental stimuli in advertising research.","Zamudio, César; Grigsby, Jamie L.; Michelsen, Meg",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/00913367.2024.2438002,zmtoeimeif,,,,Journal of Advertising,,16,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=zmtoeimeif&recordId=zmtoeimeif&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20241220,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Visual perception; Manipulation checks (Research); Research personnel; Open-ended questions,RAISE: A New Method to Develop Experimental Stimuli for Advertising Research with Image Generative Artificial Intelligence.,
"In this study, we evaluate the reliability and methodological implications of generative artificial intelligence (genAl) models, specifically ChatGPT, in classifying nuanced vaccination stances expressed in online debates. We analyzed 295 comments from three Reddit threads discussing vaccination using multiple measurements with different ChatGPT model versions (4o and 4.5). Each comment was contextually paired with its parent comment to capture argumentative stance, and analysis was enhanced by including a preliminary qualitative thematic evaluation. Our findings show moderate-to-strong consistency across measurements, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.64 to 0.77. However, there is variability in interpreting nuanced arguments, such as attributing disease reduction solely to sanitation rather than vaccination, or distinguishing between rhetorical style and genuine argumentative extremism. These variations point to deeper interpretive ambiguities that current generative AI models handle inconsistently. We discuss both the opportunities and challenges of using generative AI for qualitative and quantitative content analysis, emphasizing the importance of careful prompt design and methodological transparency.

"Software unit testing is a critical verification step to ensure the correctness and reliability of software. However, manual writing of test cases is a time-consuming and error-prone process. This paper examines the integration of generative artificial intelligence models (LLM) into software test engineering and addresses automatic unit test generation. In the proposed method, test functions in pytest format are generated from the GPT-4 model using sample functions written in Python and these outputs are systematically evaluated. The validity of the tests is tested in terms of functional correctness by running them with pytest, and code coverage rates are measured with the coverage.py tool. Furthermore, the automatic generation of edge-case scenarios was analysed. The results show that the proposed method can produce tests with high accuracy and an average code coverage rate as high as 100%. At least one edge-case for each function was successfully tested. The results obtained show that generative artificial intelligence-based test generation can be integrated into software development processes and can significantly speed up and improve the accuracy of manual test writing.

"With the wide application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology in society, GenAI literacy and critical thinking are considered vital competencies for success in the future. As future teachers, pre-service teachers (PSTs) must possess these key competencies. Previous research has pointed out that although learning and applying GenAI knowledge and technology can improve PSTs’ GenAI literacy, the results were not as expected. This study incorporated a KWL (Know, Want, Learned)-based reflection strategy based on the SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer) model, and proposed an RSCQA (Reflection, Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer) approach, which aims to help PSTs develop GenAI literacy and critical thinking. A quasi-experiment was designed for this study to verify the validity of the RSCQA approach, which was used by the experimental group, while the Conventional SCQA (CSCQA) approach was used by the control group. Results of the study demonstrated that using the RSCQA approach improved PSTs’ GenAI literacy and critical thinking, and they excelled in multimodal demonstration capability. This study also conducted an ENA analysis of the content of PSTs’ reflections, and the results demonstrated that reflective strategies help PSTs engage in higher-order cognitive activities. The results of the qualitative interviews further indicated that the reflective strategy enhanced PSTs’ learning effectiveness and strengthened their critical thinking. Overall, the RSCQA approach helps PSTs engage in reflective learning and perform better in GenAI literacy and critical thinking.

"Although image-generative AI (GAI) has sparked heated discussion among engineers and designers, its role in CAD (computer-aided design) education, particularly during the conceptual design phase, remains not sufficiently explored. To address this, we examined the integration of GAI into the early stages of design in a CAD class. Specifically, we conducted an in-class workshop introducing Midjourney for conceptual design and released a home assignment on mood board design for hands-on GAI design practice. Twenty students completed the workshop and assignment from a CAD class at a research-intensive university. We collected and analyzed data from surveys, students’ prompts, and design artifacts to explore their perceptions of GAI, prompt behaviors, and design creativity and conducted a correlation analysis between these variables. After the workshop, students significantly rated GAI as more useful and user-friendly in design and found it more supportive in terms of design efficiency and aesthetics, while we did not find a significant difference in design creativity. By analyzing 365 prompts used for completing home tasks, we identified three types of prompt behaviors: generation, modification, and selection, as well as classified three types of workflows: exploration, two-step, and multi-step. The correlation analysis showed that design creativity changes significantly and positively correlated with their prompt behaviors. Students with more multi-step prompts produced more creative artifacts based on the instructors’ evaluation. This exploratory study offered valuable insights into the integration of GAI in CAD education and suggested potential directions for future GAI curricula and tools in design education.","Zhu, Wangda; Xing, Wanli; Kim, Eddy Man; Li, Chenglu; Wang, Yuanzhi; Yang, Yoon; Liu, Zifeng",JSTOR Journals,,,rdoiu2vnnr,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,183,166,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=rdoiu2vnnr&recordId=xrjr4hehpf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,"Integrating image-generative AI into conceptual design in computer-aided design education : Exploring student perceptions, prompt behaviors, and artifact creativity",28
"Discussing with generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has been recognized as a method for obtaining information. Researchers have noticed that students’ ability to search, select, and evaluate information (e.g., their online information-searching strategies) may affect the quality of their learning and discussion with GAI. In this study, we conducted an experiment in an online science course to explore the role of online information-searching strategies (OISS) in the process of students discussing with GAI. A total of 46 high school students participated in the study. In the course, students wrote question prompts to the GAI, accessed information provided by the GAI, and composed their science reports. We collected the students’ OISS tendency questionnaire, science reports, and the question prompt content they wrote to GAI. According to the results, students with higher OISS outperformed those with lower OISS in terms of content accuracy and logical descriptions in their science reports. The ordered network analysis (ONA) results showed a significant difference in the prompting sequences of the two groups of students. Students with higher OISS gradually developed their knowledge models of scientific concepts by organizing information and finding connections or inconsistencies among different types of knowledge. Students with lower OISS strategies focused more on content extension and consolidation of independent expertise. We labeled the higher OISS students as holism learners, while the lower OISS students were labeled as atomism learners. Lastly, the study findings underscore the importance of guiding students to comprehensively structure and synthesize their knowledge within GAI-based learning environments.","Lai, Chiu-Lin",JSTOR Journals,,,gihuxkgpkz,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,262,241,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=gihuxkgpkz&recordId=ld6l777xub&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,Consolidate knowledge or build scientific models?

Second, GenAI's increasing capacity for no-code programming is expected to democratize robot training, improvement, and fine-tuning by frontline employees, thus improving robot performance. Third, the implications of GenAI robots are outlined for frontline employees (i.e., their work and job scopes, and a new role as citizen developer), customers (i.e., improved customer experiences and service outcomes), and the service firm (i.e., a pathway to cost-effective service excellence, continuous improvement and agility, alleviation of labor shortage, and the introduction of new ethical, fairness, privacy, health, and safety risks into physical service encounters). This article is the first to explore the theoretical and practical implications of GenAI robots in physical service encounters and opens a new stream of service research.","Wirtz, Jochen; Stock-Homburg, Ruth",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/10946705251340487,h4xsrj2iuz,,,4,Journal of Service Research,,543,527,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=h4xsrj2iuz&recordId=h4xsrj2iuz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251101,Sage Publications Inc.,Customer services; Computer programming; Other Computer Related Services; Custom Computer Programming Services; Computer systems design and related services (except video game design and development); <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Ethical problems; Excellence; Robot design &amp; construction,Generative AI Meets Service Robots.,28
"Grading student assignments, especially in large classes, is a time-consuming task, making the automation of the assessment process highly desirable. With the rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), tools such as ChatGPT, Claude AI, and DeepSeek have emerged as possible solutions for automating this process. This study examines the effectiveness of the three GAI tools in grading three types of student assignments: graphical data models, code quality assignment, and text-based assignments. We conducted experiments across three undergraduate courses, comparing AI-generated grades with those manually assigned by teachers. The results showed that while GAI tools performed well in grading structured assignments like graphical models and code assessments, they struggled with the subjective nature of descriptive text evaluations. Claude AI performed best in evaluating graphical models, while DeepSeek outperformed ChatGPT in assessing code quality. However, deviations were observed in grading descriptive assignments, raising concerns about the reliability of GAI tools for tasks that require deep contextual understanding and creativity. The study highlights the potential of GAI to reduce grading time and provide constructive feedback, but also emphasizes the need for careful integration of these tools into educational practices. Ethical concerns, particularly regarding data privacy, suggest that offline or institutionally hosted GAI models could provide a viable solution.","Novak, Matija; Androcec, Darko; Picek, Ruben",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,,ozxpicagzf,,,,"2025 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM), Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM), 2025 International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250918,"University of Split, FESB","Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Photonics and Electrooptics; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Ethics; Data privacy; Codes; Graphical models; Automation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Chatbots; Data models; Reliability; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; higher education; assessment automation; student assignments",Comparison of Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools in the Assessment of Student Assignments,
"Industrial quality control processes are of vital importance for the optimization of production lines. This study presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of various generative AI models for image-based anomaly detection in industrial quality control processes. Using a dataset composed of real-world images collected from a bus chassis production line, a comparative analysis was conducted across different architectures based on metrics such as ACC, AUC, resource usage, and training time. Experimental results revealed that the AdversarialVAE model achieved the highest performance, attaining 83% accuracy and 88% AUC with $256 \times 256$ input size. Moreover, the AdversarialVAE model has been shown to be effective not only in terms of classification performance but also in terms of computational efficiency. These findings clearly demonstrate that the Generative Zoo framework, which encompasses a variety of model architectures, serves as a powerful toolkit for industrial anomaly detection. They also underscore the critical importance of selecting the most appropriate model based on the specific requirements of the application.","Uz, Taha; Erdogmus, Alim Kerem; Bayar, Dilara; Sahabas, Omer; Cokunlu, Gurol; Tas, Muhammed Oguz",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ASYU67174.2025.11208495,vpqq7aludr,,,,"2025 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU), Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU), 2025 Innovations in",,5,1,,True,20250910,IEEE,"Aerospace; Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Performance evaluation; Training; Technological innovation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Process control; Quality control; Production; Computer architecture; Anomaly detection; <mark>generative</mark> zoo; industrial anomaly detection; image-based quality control; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>",Performance Evaluation of Generative AI Models in Industrial Quality Control: A Case Study in Bus Chassis White-Body Inspection,
"Generative artificial intelligence systems are increasingly appearing in decision-support processes, so it is essential to address the extent to which these models are prone to human-like cognitive biases. This study investigates whether anchoring bias can be detected in large language models in a simulated market decision-making situation where the AI’s task was to determine the launch price of a new smartwatch. In the experimental setup, five different generative AI models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 3 Beta, Sonar) were tested with low and high numerical anchor values. For each model, 20 runs were performed under both conditions (a total of 200 queries), and the results were analyzed using an independent sample t-test and an anchoring index. Based on the results, the GPT-4o model showed significant anchoring bias ($\mathrm{AnI}=13.12 \%$), while in the case of GPT-4.5, this was more moderate (AnI $=5.67 \%$). The responses of the other models were completely consistent, with a standard deviation of 0 and no changes observed between different anchoring conditions. The hypothesis tests confirmed that the anchoring effect is not universally characteristic, but rather a model-dependent behavioral peculiarity. The study contributes to the measurement of bias sensitivity in artificial intelligence and to the development of a possible future behavioral benchmark. The practical significance of the research is that it draws attention to the fact that individual models may be sensitive to irrelevant numerical contexts, which can lead to biased results in business decisions. Therefore, for companies, not only language performance but also this type of bias profile may be an important consideration when selecting and deploying generative AI systems.","Koteczki, Reka; Balassa, Boglarka Eisinger",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CogInfoCom66819.2025.11200816,psrgezv64j,,,,"2025 IEEE 16th International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom), Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom), 2025 IEEE 16th International Conference on",,000120,000115,,True,20250908,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Sensitivity; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Decision making; Sonar; Pricing; Data models; Numerical models; Indexes; Context modeling; Anchoring bias; Large Language Models (LLMs); Cognitive biases in <mark>AI</mark>; Decision-making",Anchoring Bias in Generative AI: A Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models in a Pricing Scenario,

"Zusammenfassung: Generative Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) ist ein entscheidender Wertschöpfungsfaktor in der Finanzbranche, da sie bestehende Prozesse optimiert und neue Geschäftsmodelle ermöglicht. Während zahlreiche Forschungsbeiträge technische, soziale und ethische Aspekte generativer KI untersuchen, adressiert dieser Beitrag insbesondere die strategischen, technologischen und organisationalen Herausforderungen bei der Implementierung generativer KI. Anhand einer Fallstudie bei der DZ BANK AG wird untersucht, wie ein hybrider Plattformansatz eine strategisch fundierte Einführung generativer KI ermöglicht. Technologisch stellt die zentrale IT standardisierte und wiederverwendbare Komponenten bereit, während die Fachbereiche eigenständig KI-basierte Lösungen entwickeln und anpassen. Organisational erfordert dies eine enge Abstimmung zwischen zentraler Steuerung und dezentraler Nutzung, um sowohl Skalierbarkeit als auch Flexibilität zu gewährleisten. Ein iterativer Rollout in „Wellen“ kombiniert technologische Absicherung mit einer stufenweisen Integration in bestehende Geschäftsprozesse. Die Plattform bietet nicht nur eine kontrollierte und sichere Infrastruktur, sondern adressiert auch Herausforderungen wie regulatorische Anforderungen, Datenqualität und die notwendige Qualifikation der MitarbeiterInnen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass der Plattformansatz technologische Komplexität reduziert und gleichzeitig organisationale Agilität fördert.

"This paper presents a streamlined and effective methodology for integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots into educational and research activities focused on computer networks. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of generative AI to assist in each phase of a typical network analysis workflow: selecting appropriate software tools, generating and capturing network traffic, extracting relevant data, and conducting iterative analysis. For the experimental part, we went through these steps to analyze the functioning of the TCP protocol. The methodology begins with the identification of suitable software tools to achieve the objectives. For the experimental part, iPerf is used for traffic generation and TShark for packet capture and processing. To address the challenges of manual traffic generation and data collection, AI-assisted scripting (e.g., PowerShell) is employed to automate these tasks. Given the limitations of chatbot environments in handling raw packet capture files (.pcapng) or large files, the methodology includes a step for transforming these files into lightweight, structured formats (e.g.,. csv) using AI-generated scripts (e.g., Windows Batch files). These processed files are then analyzed within the chatbot environment using iterative prompt engineering, enabling dynamic exploration of network behavior, such as TCP protocol analysis. The study demonstrates that generative AI chatbots significantly enhance productivity by aiding in tool selection, code generation, data transformation, and analytical reasoning. This methodology not only simplifies complex technical tasks but also promotes deeper understanding and engagement in computer networking education and research.","Peculea, Adrian; Dadarlat, Vasile; Cebuc, Emil; Buzura, Sorin",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/RoEduNet68395.2025.11208419,tyfw7z3ck5,,,,"2025 24th RoEduNet Conference: Networking in Education and Research (RoEduNet), Networking in Education and Research (RoEduNet), 2025 24th RoEduNet Conference:",,6,1,,True,20250917,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Productivity; Protocols; Education; Telecommunication traffic; Chatbots; Computer networks; Iterative methods; Prompt engineering; Object recognition; Software tools; methodology; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> chatbots; computer networks; education; research; task automation; scripting",A Lightweight Methodology for Using Generative AI Chatbots in Education and Research in the Field of Computer Networks,

"The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare are experiencing rapid growth and continuous evolution. AI is utilized across a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from medical diagnosis and treatment planning to patient care and drug discovery. It offers fast and reliable solutions for medical professionals, especially with big data analysis and deep learning methods. In this process, balanced datasets with high-precision and high-quality are essential for the wide and effective use of artificial intelligence systems. However, a significant challenge in healthcare is the imbalance and scarcity of biomedical data. This scarcity is often attributed to difficulties in data collection, stemming from factors such as device incompatibilities and the complexities of ethical committee approvals. Consequently, the generation of synthetic data has become a necessity rather than merely an advantage in the healthcare domain. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the promising methods to eliminate data insufficiency and imbalance by producing synthetic medical images similar to data taken from real patients. In this study, a sample scenario was applied to examine the generation of synthetic data and its effects with GAN models. For this purpose, synthetic image generation was performed with StyleGAN and ProjectedGAN models using the APTOS2019 dataset, which pertains to diabetic retinopathy (DR) disease. The generated images were subsequently compared using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric. The analysis revealed that the StyleGAN model demonstrated superior performance in synthetic image generation, achieving an FID value of 5.51, whereas ProjectedGAN resulted in an FID of 11.7485. The generated unlabeled synthetic images were labeled using the pseudo-labeling method and added to the training dataset in the classifier application to investigate the effect of synthetic images on the classification performance.","Demir, Feyzanur Banu; Cicioglu, Murtaza; Dirik, Ahmet Emir",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ASYU67174.2025.11208399,ukmyjopuwj,,,,"2025 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU), Intelligent Systems and Applications Conference (ASYU), 2025 Innovations in",,6,1,,True,20250910,IEEE,"Aerospace; Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Technological innovation; Image synthesis; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Quality assessment; Planning; Reliability; Bioinformatics; Medical diagnostic imaging; Synthetic data; Synthetic Image Generation; Biomedical Data; Advanced <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> in Healthcare; <mark>Generative</mark> Adversarial Network (GAN); Fundus Images",Medical Image Generation and Quality Assessment with Generative Artificial Intelligence,
"Today, the nationwide expansion of big-box supermarkets and the shift toward chain stores in the food industry have led to a separation between production and distribution. As a result, public awareness of Japanese food culture and of the processes through which agricultural and marine products are produced and delivered to the table has been declining. In other words, the connection between food and agriculture, as well as fisheries, has become increasingly fragmented. Additionally, although the number of inbound travelers to Japan is increasing and interest in Japanese cuisine is growing, many visitors are only exposed to superficial information about Japanese food culture and traditional ingredients through social media platforms. In response to these issues, our objective is to utilize information and communication technology (ICT) to reconnect “food” with “agriculture and fisheries,” as well as with “travel.” To achieve this, we are developing technologies that deepen public understanding of the agricultural, fisheries, and culinary industries by interviewing producers and chefs who possess extensive knowledge of Japanese food culture and a strong commitment to food quality. We aim to convert these interviews into textual content using ICT and disseminate this content to society. As an initial step, we aim to semi-automatically construct a website that introduces chefs and producers based on these interviews. This paper demonstrates that this objective can be achieved by introducing narrative structuring and generative AI technologies to summarize interviews for website content generation. Once this technological framework is established, producers and chefs will be able to efficiently process and disseminate the content of their discussions using ICT. This advancement will contribute to the revitalization of local communities and serve as a step toward promoting food sustainability within society.","Ito, Atsushi; Uneme, Lily; Takahashi, Yoshiyuki; Hiramatsu, Yuko; Harada, Yasunari",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CogInfoCom66819.2025.11200539,fhxq7l4a4z,,,,"2025 IEEE 16th International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom), Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom), 2025 IEEE 16th International Conference on",,000056,000049,,True,20250908,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Social networking (online); Production; Oral communication; Fisheries; Chatbots; Agriculture; Information and communication technology; Interviews; Sustainable development; Food culture, Narrative, <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>, Summarizing conversation, SNS",Describing Japanese Food Culture Using Narrative and Generative AI,

"Generative AI (GenAI) revolutionizes students’ learning experiences in higher education, yet understanding students’ engagement with these technologies, particularly emotional engagement, remains unexplored. This study explores postgraduate engineering students’ interaction with GenAI and how it shapes their emotional attachment and learning experiences. Using an ethnographic qualitative approach, data were collected through semi-structured interviews and contextual observations. The findings reveal four qualitatively differentiated phenomena of students’ emotional engagement: (i) Reaction Variability- curiosity and frustration depending on GenAI responses. Such variations lead to motivation or disengagement in learning. (ii) Engagement Quality- GenAI facilitated both deep and passive learning. Passive engagement diminishes critical thinking and promotes surface-level learning. (iii) Academic Integrity- overreliance on GenAI for quick and easy solutions. This reliance can lead to reduced creativity and originality in the learning process, and (iv) Mindset- socio-economic status and prior technology experience shape students’ attitude toward GenAI use. While GenAI holds transformative potential, it presents both challenges and opportunities within educational settings, especially in developing nations.

"The rapid development of chatbots undergirded by large language models calls for teachers and students to explore using chatbots in educational ways. Given this new phenomenon, education researchers need to explore students’ responses to chatbots to comprehensively understand their experiences. This study adopted purposive sampling to interview Taiwanese university students ( N = 17) who had used ChatGPT for a semester in an open elective course. Transcripts were analyzed using the grounded theory approach. Findings indicate that while the challenges posed by ChatGPT perturbed the students, their actual interactions with the chatbot revealed that it lacks some vital epistemic aspects. ChatGPT cannot discern what is true, and cannot experience the world as humans do. Hence, while it could assist humans in some epistemic endeavors, the students concluded that they need to assume epistemic agency in its use. The findings imply that educators may need to design academic tasks that further develop undergraduates’ epistemic agency for the critical and creative use of chatbot-generated artifacts.","Tian, Ting; Chai, Ching Sing; Chen, Mei-Hwa; Liang, Jyh-Chong",JSTOR Journals,,,j5vihnvrdf,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,165,151,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=j5vihnvrdf&recordId=ztlxy6awwr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,,,University students’ perceptions of learning with generative artificial intelligence,28
"Open-source generative AI technologies offer transparent and customizable alternatives to proprietary AI systems, the concept of which closely aligns with the principles of open innovation. Organizations with strong open-source orientations may have greater absorptive capacity to adopt open-source generative AI technologies. However, adopting such technologies into the organizations is not always guaranteed because ethical, privacy, and regulatory concerns on open-source generative AI usage create normative uncertainty that can reduce organizations' willingness to adopt the technology, particularly when it is used in customer-facing products or services rather than integrated into internal processes. This study draws on organizational learning theory and open innovation literature to examine how open-source orientation affects open-source generative AI adoption under normative uncertainty, and how this relationship depends on organizational exploiting and exploring behaviors. Using global survey data from the Linux Foundation, we test our hypotheses with ordered logistic regression and interaction effects. The results show that open-source oriented organizations are more likely to adopt open-source generative AI, but this effect weakens when normative uncertainty is high, especially in product-related use cases. These findings extend absorptive capacity theory by highlighting ethical ambiguity as a key moderating factor and provide practical insights into how organizations can responsibly approach open-source generative AI adoption.","Hong, Suengjae; Ryee, Hakshun; Jin, Xiaoyan; Yang, Daegyu",Business Source Ultimate,,10.3390/jtaer20030250,j5mxi4hlpn,,,3,Journal of Theoretical &amp; Applied Electronic Commerce Research,,,250,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=j5mxi4hlpn&recordId=j5mxi4hlpn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250901,MDPI,Open source software; Organizational behavior; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Principle (Philosophy); Curiosity; Adoption of ideas; Ethical problems,How Organizations Choose Open-Source Generative AI Under Normative Uncertainty: The Moderating Role of Exploitative and Exploratory Behaviors.,20
"The cyber threat landscape is witnessing a diverse and widespread evolution in threat actors' strategies, especially at the level of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Current solutions often fall behind in detecting these new and sophisticated attacks due to their stealthy nature and the evolving use of variant attack methods. The evolution of APT variants causes challenges by introducing inconsiderate attack patterns, for which most security defense systems are not prepared. In this paper, we introduce APTMORPH, an automated solution that generates APT variants by anticipating the next $n$ variant techniques that can occur using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). APTMORPH is trained using APTs from the MITRE ATT&amp;CK knowledge base to learn, augment, and evaluate the security context of anticipated techniques. APTMORPH integrates an Adversarial Learning Loop, which consists of two modules: a Technique Generator and a Technique Discriminator. The generator generates the possible variant techniques while the discriminator ensures only the most relevant techniques remain. The process is also supported by a Security Context Evaluator using a Reinforcement Learning Loop via a Monte-Carlo rollouts method. Assisted with threat hunting practitioners, we built a Proof of Concept and conducted a rigorous evaluation using global APT campaigns, public campaigns from MITRE ATT&amp;CK, public Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports, and an APTs dataset. The obtained results confirm that APTMORPH can generate relevant variants of real-world APT campaigns with ≈90% technique similarity ratio, ≈83% common tactic ratio, and ≈80% similarity with public CTI.

"Generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT have found prominence in recent times with their ability to generate texts, images, etc. Several questions pertaining to ethical and legal issues surrounding ChatGPT have arisen. In this paper, I discuss the nature and background of generative AI, situating its development in the historical context of AI. I then discuss my primary research questions: is sufficient attention paid in the literature on ethics of AI to the principle of beneficence and is there theoretical clarity on its meaning? I highlight that while there is great deal of discussion on what harms can arise from generative AI and how to stop them, there is very little discussion on what amounts to AI-for-good, particularly in the literature of AI ethics and regulation. To the extent that such discussion exists, it pushes ahead with suggesting specific solutions, without fully addressing the underlying question of what makes their prescriptions beneficent. I demonstrate that the principle of beneficence as understood in biomedical ethics and human rights frameworks has limited utility for the ethics of generative AI. These gaps in the AI regulation are prominent, as they can derail long term progress of generative AI and the realization of its full potential.","Singh Chauhan, Krishna Deo",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/13600869.2024.2364989,hj2jqtegc5,,,2,"International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology",,174,152,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=hj2jqtegc5&recordId=hj2jqtegc5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,"<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology); <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Bioethics; ChatGPT; Research questions",ChatGPT for good?

"ABSTRACT The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has dramatically impacted human decision‐making, productivity, and human agentic role delivery, thereby transforming HRM practices, particularly in recruitment and selection. Traditional recruitment and selection methods involve the dynamic interplay of structure and human agents. This interplay is changing with the emergence of human‐technology‐conjoined agencies that share task delivery and role performance responsibilities, thereby altering and creating new recruitment and selection routines. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 43 HR and talent acquisition leaders in a high‐growth emerging market context to understand the transformational role of discriminative and generative AI technology agencies in changing recruitment and selection practices. This study contributes to existing HRM literature by demonstrating the impact of discriminative and generative AI in recruitment and selection and the simultaneous human‐AI collaboration and algorithmic management of humans emerging as a consequence. Furthermore, we theorize the transformational changes in structures and processes across the entire recruitment and selection process emerging from conjoined agencies.","Dutta, Debolina; Naveen, P.

"This study explores how the integration of generative artificial intelligence, multi-objective evolutionary optimization, and reinforcement learning can enable sustainable and cost-effective decision-making in supply chain strategy. Using real-world retail demand data enriched with synthetic sustainability attributes, we trained a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate plausible future demand scenarios. These were used to seed a Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) aimed at identifying Pareto-optimal sourcing strategies that balance delivery cost and CO2 emissions. The resulting Pareto frontier revealed favorable trade-offs, enabling up to 50% emission reductions for only a 10–15% cost increase. We further deployed a deep Q-learning (DQN) agent to dynamically manage weekly shipments under a selected balanced strategy. The reinforcement learning policy achieved an additional 10% emission reduction by adaptively switching between green and conventional transport modes in response to demand and carbon pricing. Importantly, the agent also demonstrated resilience during simulated supply disruptions by rerouting decisions in real time. This research contributes a novel AI-based decision architecture that combines generative modeling, evolutionary search, and adaptive control to support sustainability in complex and uncertain supply chains.","Necula, Sabina-Cristiana; Rieder, Emanuel",Business Source Ultimate,,10.3390/jtaer20030240,e4j2w26ntn,,,3,Journal of Theoretical &amp; Applied Electronic Commerce Research,,,240,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=e4j2w26ntn&recordId=e4j2w26ntn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250901,MDPI,Supply chains; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Pareto optimum; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Reinforcement learning; Carbon emissions; Multi-objective optimization,Generative and Adaptive AI for Sustainable Supply Chain Design.,20
"A key stumbling block in effective supply chain risk management for companies and policymakers is a lack of visibility on interdependent supply network relationships. Relationship prediction, also called link prediction is an emergent area of supply chain surveillance research that aims to increase the visibility of supply chains using data-driven techniques. Existing methods have been successful for predicting relationships but struggle to extract the context in which these relationships are embedded – such as the products being supplied or locations they are supplied from. Lack of context prevents practitioners from distinguishing transactional relations from established supply chain relations, hindering accurate estimations of risk. In this work, we develop a new Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) enhanced machine learning framework that leverages pre-trained language models as embedding models combined with machine learning models to predict supply chain relationships within knowledge graphs. By integrating Generative AI techniques, our approach captures the nuanced semantic relationships between entities, thereby improving supply chain visibility and facilitating more precise risk management. Using data from a real case study, we show that GenAI-enhanced link prediction surpasses all benchmarks, and demonstrate how GenAI models can be explored and effectively used in supply chain risk management.","Zheng, Ge; Brintrup, Alexandra",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/00207543.2025.2543964,4pmx4l3obj,,,,International Journal of Production Research,,23,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=4pmx4l3obj&recordId=4pmx4l3obj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250812,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,,Enhancing supply chain visibility with generative AI: an exploratory case study on relationship prediction in knowledge graphs.,
"Establishing endogenous intelligence capabilities within telecommunication networks in the form of native artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a significant topic of research for promoting the prospects of 6th Generation (6G) networks. In the upcoming 6G era, the network is expected to provide services for building and deploying distributed AI applications in the network infrastructure, and such applications will be used solely by the network or offered to operators or third parties as new services. This paper begins by analysing the current status of standardisation in the network AI domain, and next elaborates on the major shortcomings of the current approaches for natively setting up network AI services. On this basis, we present the concept of Native Network Generative AI (NNGAI), which builds on and further advances the concept of native AI for telecom networks. To formulate the paradigm of NNGAI, we first devise the network architecture, and then finally the underlying logical flow of network services to realize NNGAI by carefully inserting generative AI technologies into both the architecture and the service flow of 6G networks.","Sun, Wanfei; Xu, Hui; Wang, Da; Wang, Hucheng; Guney, Nazli; Saglam, Mehmet Izzet; Gan, Zihui",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/SIU66497.2025.11112244,tadwnvm4c5,,,,"2025 33rd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU), Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU), 2025 33rd",,4,1,,True,20250625,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; 6G mobile communication; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Buildings; <mark>Artificial</mark> neural networks; Network architecture; Signal processing; Communications technology; Telecommunications; Native Network <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; 6G Network Architecture; Network Service",Generative 6G Network Architecture and Service: From Native AI to Native Network Generative AI,
"Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the number of services providing generative AI has been steadily increasing. As different services enter the market, the generative AI interfaces users experience become more diverse. However, none of the services has yet established itself as the dominant tool, and which interface component affects user preferences the most has yet to be identified. This study investigates user preferences based on the interface of generative AI services currently on the market. We investigated users' preferred interface components by setting the output data type, generative style, output variation, reference style, and generation history provided by the current generative AI service as properties. We collected data from 500 users through a survey and conducted conjoint analysis. Users preferred the provision of 10 generation histories the most, and the second most preferred the provision of reference style in footnote format. In addition, it was found that there was no preference for the creative generative style, which can be interpreted as users being aware of the problem of hallucination in generative AI. The results of this study will help future generative AI services design interfaces that consider user experience.","Yeon, Jesun; Jung, Youchan; Baek, Yongki; Lee, Daeho; Shin, Jungwoo; Chung, Won Young",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/10447318.2024.2400379,v43zshl6sf,,,12,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,,7637,7626,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=v43zshl6sf&recordId=v43zshl6sf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250615,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,User interfaces; Conjoint analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Logistic regression analysis; Hallucinations (<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>),User Preferences on a Generative AI User Interface Through a Choice Experiment.,41
"Adoption of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) has stimulated interest in assessing how foundation-model competencies appear in current job advertisements across various fields and industries. This study investigates how Taiwanese job postings are integrating generative AI across distinct occupational families, focusing on the depth and nature of AI-related skill requirements. Drawing on a dataset of 628 postings, two complementary strategies are employed in order to assess both the prevalence and the specific skill sets associated with these technologies. The combination comprises frequency-based metric of AI references within each post and a targeted topic model isolating text specifically referencing generative AI. Results indicate that technologically oriented and creatively driven families, such as Computer and Mathematical and Arts, Design, Entertainment, demonstrate substantially higher mentions of foundation-model capabilities. In contrast, managerial and sales-centric roles tend to reference AI more sparingly. These findings suggest a widening skill gap in Taiwan's labor market, where requirements for AI proficiencies are particularly concentrated in fields already leveraging technical or creative expertise.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly being integrated into marketing education and is reshaping the skill sets required in marketing careers. While research has highlighted the promise and perils of incorporating GAI into education, there remains a need for a comprehensive framework to guide its effective use. In this research, the authors conduct a multipronged analysis, including a review of marketing course syllabi, a survey of marketing educators, and follow-up qualitative interviews. Building on role theory and the community of inquiry model, they propose that GAI can assume three roles in marketing education: tutor, teammate, and tool. Each role influences teaching, social, and cognitive presence differently, shaping the learning experience and preparing workplace-ready marketing graduates. For instance, as a tutor, GAI can aid students in grasping theoretical concepts, while as a teammate, it can foster collaboration by supporting brainstorming and problem-solving activities. However, ethical considerations such as data privacy, plagiarism, dependency on AI, and fairness in assessment must be addressed to ensure its responsible adoption in marketing education.

"This theoretical study rigorously investigates how generative artificial intelligence reshapes decision-making in social entrepreneurship by modeling the opportunity search process through the lens of optimal stopping theory. Social entrepreneurs often face high uncertainty and resource constraints, requiring them to strategically balance the cost of continued searching with the chance of identifying socially impactful opportunities. This study develops a formal model that captures two core mechanisms of generative AI: reducing search costs and increasing the probability of mission-aligned opportunity success. The theoretical analysis yields three key findings. First, generative AI accelerates the optimal stopping point, allowing social entrepreneurs to act more quickly on high-potential opportunities by lowering cognitive and resource burdens. Second, the influence of increased success probability outweighs that of reduced search costs, underscoring the strategic importance of insight quality over efficiency in socially embedded contexts. Third, the benefits of generative AI are amplified in uncertain environments, where it helps navigate complexity and mitigate information asymmetry. These insights contribute to a deeper conceptual understanding of how intelligent technologies transform the cognitive and strategic dimensions of social entrepreneurship, and they offer empirically testable propositions for future research at the intersection of AI, innovation, and mission-driven opportunity pursuit.","Kim, Junic",Business Source Ultimate,,10.3390/admsci15080302,34bfrxrkrr,,,8,Administrative Sciences (2076-3387),,,302,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=34bfrxrkrr&recordId=34bfrxrkrr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,MDPI,Social entrepreneurship; Decision making; Information asymmetry; Technological innovations; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Cognitive load; Optimal stopping (Mathematical statistics),Modeling Generative AI and Social Entrepreneurial Searches: A Contextualized Optimal Stopping Approach.,15

"The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools is a paradigm shift in enhanced learning methodologies and assessment techniques. This study explores the adoption of generative AI tools in higher education assessments by examining the perceptions of 353 students through a survey and 17 in-depth interviews. Anchored in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this study investigates the roles of perceived risk and tech-savviness in the use of AI tools. Perceived risk emerged as a significant deterrent, while trust and tech-savviness were pivotal in shaping student engagement with AI. Tech-savviness not only influenced adoption but also moderated the effect of performance expectancy on AI use. These insights extend UTAUT's application, highlighting the importance of considering perceived risks and individual proficiency with technology. The findings suggest educators and policymakers need to tailor AI integration strategies to accommodate students' personal characteristics and diverse needs, harnessing generative AI's opportunities and mitigating its challenges.","Oc, Yusuf; Gonsalves, Chahna; Quamina, La Toya",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/02734753241302459,4s7xf3hxzz,,,2,Journal of Marketing Education,,155,138,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=4s7xf3hxzz&recordId=4s7xf3hxzz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,Sage Publications Inc.,Technological literacy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Higher education; Risk perception; Educational evaluation; Student engagement; Educational technology; Technology Acceptance Model,Generative AI in Higher Education Assessments: Examining Risk and Tech-Savviness on Student's Adoption.,47
"Generative AI needs to collect user data to provide more accurate answers. This may raise users' privacy concern and undermine their disclosure intention. The purpose of this research is to examine generative AI user disclosure intention from the perspective of technological–social affordance. We adopted a mixed method of PLS-SEM and fsQCA to conduct data analysis. The results reveal that perceived affordance of content generation (including information association, content quality, and interactivity), perceived affordance of privacy protection (including anonymity and privacy statement), and perceived affordance of anthropomorphic interaction (including empathy and social presence) affect privacy concern and reciprocity, both of which further affect disclosure intention. The fsQCA identified two paths that trigger user disclosure intention. These results imply that generative AI platforms need to increase users' perceived affordance in order to promote their disclosure intention and ensure the continuous development of platforms.","Zhou, Tao; Wu, Xiaoying",Business Source Ultimate,,10.3390/jtaer20020099,m5imlsukmz,,,2,Journal of Theoretical &amp; Applied Electronic Commerce Research,,,99,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=m5imlsukmz&recordId=m5imlsukmz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,MDPI,Disclosure; Data analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Empathy; Intention,Examining Generative AI User Disclosure Intention: A Perceived Affordance Perspective.,20
"Generative AI (GenAI) is breaking new ground in emulating human capabilities, and content generation may only be the beginning. In this work, the authors systematize and illustrate promising areas of application of GenAI in marketing. They lay out a conceptual framework along two dimensions: (1) GenAI impact (i.e., human enhancement, human replacement) and (2) the marketing cycle stage (i.e., marketing research, marketing strategy formulation, marketing actions related to the marketing mix instruments). Based on the AI ethics literature, the authors then introduce a set of principles (i.e., ASSURANCE: Autonomy, Security, SUstainability, Representativeness, Accountability, Nonbiasedness and nondiscrimination, Crediting, Empowerment) to enable marketers to address the risks and challenges of GenAI and thereby achieve beneficial outcomes for companies, consumers, and society at large.

"Teacher burnout and student disengagement are twin crises crippling modern education, with 72% of educators overwhelmed by administrative tasks and 61% of students underserved by one-size-fits-all curricula. While generative AI tools like GPT-4 offer transformative potential, existing systems address only isolated needs—automating grading or personalizing content, but never both. This paper introduces AdaptLearn AI, the first framework to unify teacher support and student adaptation through bidirectional generative AI. Our architecture combines fine-tuned Large Large Language Models(LLMs) for dynamic content generation (e.g., adjusting STEM problems via few-shot learning) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) pipelines for instructor task automation (e.g., Individual educational plan(IEP) drafting, rubric design). Pilot tests with 5 teachers and 15 students demonstrated a 47% reduction in lesson planning time and 22% improvement in quiz scores compared to non-AI workflows validating that harmonizing stakeholder needs amplifies efficacy. Three key contributions distinguish this work: (1) a novel dual-stakeholder architecture enabling real-time synchronization between learner progress and teacher tools, (2) open-source modules for GPT-4/Large Language Model Meta AI(LLaMA) integration, prioritizing reproducibility, and (3) design guidelines for ethical AI-Ed deployment, including FERPA-compliant anonymization and bias audits. Results challenge the AI-Ed community to move beyond siloed solutions, proving that generative AI can uplift classrooms holistically—not through replacement, but partnership. Code and datasets will be open-sourced to accelerate research toward equitable, human-centered educational tools.","Gupta, Shuryansh; Tiwari, Sanjay; Arya, Mukesh; Kumar, Naman; Jain, Rishabh",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CIACON65473.2025.11189627,4phrwbider,,,,"2025 International Conference on Computing, <mark>Intelligence</mark>, and Application (CIACON), Computing, <mark>Intelligence</mark>, and Application (CIACON), 2025 International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250718,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> Pre-trained transformer; Ethics; Technological innovation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Reproducibility of results; Natural language processing; Real-time systems; Synchronization; Stakeholders; Sustainable development; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> in Education; Natural Language Processing (NLP); <mark>Generative</mark> Pre-trained Transformers (GPT); Scalable <mark>AI</mark> Architectures; Multi-modal Feedback Integration",AdaptLearn AI: A Generative AI Framework for Bidirectional Personalization in Education,

"In this paper, we propose an AI-based mock interview platform addressing effective interviewing techniques with real-time results and intelligent mock interviews for candidates. It is a combination of generative AI, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) that provides a simulated experience of real-time interviews. It still continues to use methods such as CNNs for Facial expressions analysis, emotion detection from facial expressions and Voice recognition and NLP for tone, fluency, and confidence detection of a candidate. The platform compares responses with relevant industry standards using keyword-based semantic analysis in order to evaluate domain knowledge. The main highlight of this work includes emotion and answer-based feedback, where it provides the candidate with a performance report and suggestions for improvement. This ensures that users receive dynamic, multimodal insights that are tailored to the user profile (job role and skill set) and go beyond the scope of traditional mock interviews, where all interview questions feel the same.

"Generative AI has recently emerged as a promising solution to address critical challenges in smart grid communication, including security, privacy, and efficiency. In this paper, we first introduce some concepts of smart grid and generative AI, outline their current state, and discuss the potential applications of integrating generative AI into smart grid. Then, we examine traditional and non-generative AI solutions, highlighting their limitations. Subsequently, we propose a promising solution by integrating generative AI into the smart grid to develop a generative AI-based agent, aiming to enhance the security and efficiency of smart grid communication while addressing privacy concerns. Additionally, we provide an experimental evaluation to demonstrate how the proposed solution can be applied to optimize smart grid holistically. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed generative AI agent approach can protect user privacy and significantly improve the overall efficiency and security of smart grid communication. Furthermore, we highlight future research directions for generative AI in smart grid applications, including the synergistic role of generative AI in smart grids, cross-domain applications and extensions, and quantum security of smart grids.","Zeng, M.; Xie, M.; Meng, L.; Zhang, H.; Wu, T.; Wang, J.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MNET.2025.3580477,xewkqsrlfr,,,5,"IEEE Network, Network, IEEE",,87,81,,True,20250901,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Smart grids; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Security; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Privacy; Firewalls (computing); Data privacy; Data models; Synthetic data; Training; smart grid; security; privacy; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> agent",Generative AI Enabled Secure Communication in Smart Grid: Challenges and Solutions,39
"The emergence of generative AI (GenAI) has illustrated that higher education needs to adapt to the technology. Its speed of evolution requires that we adequately prepare students for an ever-changing landscape. Toward achieving that aim, we draw on the concept of interpretive flexibility, where the interpretations, uses, and outcomes of a new technology can differ and evolve over time, often with dominant stakeholders controlling the process. To engage marketing students in this process, we propose that they be presented with these diverse interpretations now as part of GenAI literacy. Specifically, we offer three small-scale pedagogical interventions designed to address this urgent need. Given the newness of GenAI, our interventions are designed to be infused into existing marketing instruction, instead of requiring a redesign of a curriculum. With each intervention, students not only significantly decrease their confidence in the accuracy of what GenAI produces but also see reasons to examine the implications of it. Both these outcomes, we suggest, could help to maintain interpretive flexibility required to properly respond to and guide the technology as its uses, impacts, and evolution become evident. We encourage educators to prioritize a comprehensive notion of GenAI literacy in their pedagogy to maintain interpretive flexibility.","Beninger, Stefanie; Reppel, Alex; Stanton, Julie; Watson, Forrest",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/02734753251316569,7hkgidk5yz,,,2,Journal of Marketing Education,,125,112,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=7hkgidk5yz&recordId=7hkgidk5yz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,Sage Publications Inc.,Business teachers; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Higher education; Educational technology; Student engagement; Teaching methods,Facilitating Generative AI Literacy in the Face of Evolving Technology: Interventions in Marketing Classrooms.,47
"Millions have adopted tools like ChatGPT in recent years, yet indifference and resistance among employees remain. This qualitative study employs monodramatic projective techniques to explore employees' hidden assumptions and unconscious beliefs in a division attempting to integrate Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI, GAI). Through pretensive work, soliloquy, symbolic representation, modeling with intermediate objects, concretization, and role reversal techniques, the interviewees' internal representations of GAI and trust were materialized in physical artifacts, such as a ball of straw or a potted plant. The study identified three principal themes: GAI's appearance as a Janus-faced presence, unmet performance promises, and avoided proximity. Findings highlight ambiguities in acceptance and show that adoption was driven more by industry hype and normative pressures than genuine organizational needs, leading to disorganized implementation dependent on individual employee characteristics, mistrust, and disenchantment. The study's main contribution lies in refining human-robot interaction (HRI) models and psychodrama methods for GAI, emphasizing the significance of physicality and embodiment in technology-mediated relationships, identifying trust as a complex phenomenon with potential reciprocal causation, and emphasizing the importance of affective attitudes, illustrating how adoption projects can falter despite cognitive openness – all insights crucial for understanding self-driven, bottom-up GAI adaptation in an organizational context.","Hartyándi, Mátyás Jenő",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1556/204.2025.00002,uiwd5uzlfr,,,2,Society &amp; Economy,,255,235,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=uiwd5uzlfr&recordId=uiwd5uzlfr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Akademiai Kiado,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Projective techniques; Trust; Human-robot interaction; Drama therapy,Distrust and disillusionment toward generative artificial intelligence: Psychodramatic exploration of employee trust in organizational technology acceptance.,47

"Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are a strategic sector in the economy that requires continuous innovation in digital marketing strategies. As the need for attractive, professional, and easily accessible promotional content increases, generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology is a potential solution to support the efficiency and quality of visual design. This study explores how design thinking and generative AI can be used to create attractive and professional visual content. This study uses a design thinking method with seven stages including understand, observe, define point of view, ideate, prototype, test, and reflect. Each step uses specific tools such as persona profile canvas, feedback capture grids, and retrospective boards, as well as generative AI tools used in prototypes such as Canva AI, Prome AI, Leonardo AI and others to create faster and more optimal designs. The results of the study show that the use of AI in promotional materials significantly improves the efficiency and branding of MSMEs, enabling the production of high-quality content at a lower cost. However, challenges remain, related to the limited scope of the study which only focuses on one sector, namely Muslim fashion MSMEs and the lack of AI's ability to understand the nuances of brand identity in depth. This study contributes to increasing the understanding of the synergy between design thinking and generative AI, as it can provide practical guidance for MSMEs in optimizing digital marketing, and suggests future research that focuses more on assisting MSMEs directly in implementing AI in their businesses.","Indriani, Deta Nur; Kumalasari, Riesta Devi",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICoAILO66760.2025.11156061,rahi6lfikb,,,,"2025 IEEE International Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> for Learning and Optimization (ICoAILO), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> for Learning and Optimization, 2025 IEEE International Conference on (ICoAILO)",,351,345,,True,20250807,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Geoscience; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Visualization; Technological innovation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Brand management; Prototypes; Production; Reflection; Prompt engineering; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Business; micro small and medium enterprises; <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; design thinking; promotional materials",Integrating Generative AI with Design Thinking Approach to Improve Efficiency and Relevancy of MSMEs Promotional Content,

"As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools become more prevalent in education, understanding their impact on student learning, satisfaction, and self-efficacy is critical. This study examines how students’ perceptions of GenAI influence their satisfaction with instructors and their academic self-efficacy in fully asynchronous/hybrid online upper-level marketing courses. Using survey data from three online courses at a southeastern public university, we assess whether ChatGPT, a widely used GenAI, serves as a beneficial tool in self-directed learning environments. Our findings indicate that students with positive perceptions of ChatGPT report higher satisfaction with their instructor, which in turn enhances their self-efficacy. However, this effect is contingent on students’ perceived learning, with those who perceive lower learning gains benefiting the most from ChatGPT usage. These results suggest that while GenAI tools such as ChatGPT can support students in online courses, their impact is not uniform across all learners. Our research contributes to the growing discourse on GenAI in education by providing empirical evidence on its pedagogical implications and offering recommendations for responsible integration. Future research may explore GenAI’s role in diverse learning contexts and assess its long-term influence on student performance.","Haderlie, Todd C.

"Fully-decoupled RAN (FD-RAN) has emerged as one of the most promising architectures for next-generation mobile communication networks to enable flexible resource utilization and cater to diverse user requirements, owing to its complete decoupling of control, uplink and downlink entities. AI-native solutions, including AI-assisted air interfaces and mobility management, hold significant promise for achieving these objectives. However, the efficacy of such solutions hinges on accurate wireless channel knowledge. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of a Digital Twin Channel (DTC), which leverages ray tracing to generate channels based on digitalized environments. To mitigate the complexity of constructing precise DTCs in practical scenarios, we propose the Generative Digital Twin Channel (GDTC). This approach employs generative AI (GAI) models for environment reconstruction and radio wave propagation modeling, effectively empowering FD-RAN. We further present a comprehensive GDTC pipeline designed to produce accurate channels from environment and support decision-making across various communication tasks. To illustrate the capabilities of GDTC, we demonstrate through a case study to realize the feedback-free transmission task, which represents a promising paradigm envisioned for 6G. We utilize the vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to recover a specific channel accurately, as well as generate the representative channel optimized for feedback-free transmission.","Liu, Zongxi; Chen, Jiacheng; Xu, Yunting; Du, Hongyang; Zhou, Haibo",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MCOM.001.2400753,wozird3fq5,,,10,"IEEE Communications Magazine, Communications Magazine, IEEE, IEEE Commun.

"Game theory offers a powerful framework for analyzing strategic interactions among decision-makers, providing tools to model, analyze, and predict their behavior. However, implementing game theory can be challenging due to difficulties in deriving solutions, understanding interactions, and ensuring optimal performance. Traditional non-AI and discriminative AI approaches have made valuable contributions but struggle with limitations in handling large-scale games and dynamic scenarios. In this context, generative AI emerges as a promising solution because of its superior data analysis and generation capabilities. This paper comprehensively summarizes the challenges, solutions, and outlooks of combining generative AI with game theory. We start with reviewing the limitations of traditional non-AI and discriminative AI approaches in employing game theory, and then highlight the necessity and advantages of integrating generative AI. Next, we explore the applications of generative AI in various stages of the game theory lifecycle, including model formulation, solution derivation, and strategy improvement.

"This paper introduces MetaClues, an AI-driven framework that integrates generative AI and Metaverse technology to deliver a constructivist learning experience. This innovative system combines image-to-3D generation, large language models, and text-to-image models to create progressive clues within a virtual campus. Learners engage in thematic zones, interact with AI-powered non-playable characters, and manipulate artifact items—creating, fusing, or exchanging them—to steer their own discovery process.At the heart of MetaClues is the goal of uncovering or recreating a secret artifact, a multidisciplinary item rich with educational significance. Learners follow progressive clues tied to a relevance score for each item they possess. This scoring system evaluates an item’s connection to the secret artifact across multiple dimensions, offering insights into its value. To unlock additional clues, learners must create, fuse, or exchange items, refining their understanding of the artifact based on these scores. This adaptive approach strikes a balance between structured, domain-specific learning and open-ended creativity, fostering active engagement.A pilot study with 19 participants showed notable improvements in participation, knowledge retention, and motivation to explore further. Impressively, 84% of novice learners gained a substantive understanding of multidisciplinary concepts. Evaluations using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) confirmed high usability and educational impact.Using generative AI as a collaborative tool, MetaClues aims to transform learners from passive recipients into creative problem solvers.

"This study investigates the changing junction between generative artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time user interface (UI) customisation inside multimedia applications. Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers are changing the design environment as they develop by allowing interfaces that are not only smart but also very flexible. These methods change the conventional design paradigm toward a more collaborative, responsive approach by allowing designers and consumers to co-create tailored UIs that dynamically adjust to individual needs, behaviours, and environments. Reflecting a growing global interest in user-driven generative design, our bibliometric study from 2015 to 2025 shows a steady increase in academic output in this field. Particularly notable in their contributions to the educational and technical progress of this domain have been institutions such as Xidian University and Google Research. The study emphasises a movement toward more interactive and context-aware systems using generative artificial intelligence to enhance user experience across several media channels. However, together with the creative possibilities, this incorporation of artificial intelligence into UI design also brings important ethical obligations. Systems that not only improve functionality and aesthetics but also respect user autonomy, guarantee openness, and protect privacy must be developed.

"Lung cancer continues to be a predominant cause of cancer-related mortality globally, and early diagnosis with computed tomography (CT) imaging markedly enhances patient outcomes. The limited availability of annotated medical imaging data presents a significant obstacle in developing effective deep learning models for lung nodule detection. This paper presents a system based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic lung nodule images, tackling the issues of data imbalance and augmentation in medical imaging. Utilizing the LIDC-IDRI dataset, comprising expert-annotated thoracic CT scans, we train a conditional GAN to produce high-quality synthetic lung nodule patches based on size and malignancy characteristics. Synthetic data is combined with real samples to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, leading to enhanced performance metrics in accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC-ROC. Qualitative and quantitative assessments indicate that our GAN-generated images closely mimic authentic nodules, as validated by radiomic feature distributions and visual Turing tests. The suggested generative methodology improves model generalizability, facilitates clinical decision-making, and establishes a foundation for data-efficient AI systems in pulmonary diagnostics.

"The purpose of this study is to optimize the product design of existing VR devices by using generative AI with high development potential, and at the same time, to improve the usability of VR devices by remedying the weaknesses of current generative AI through collaborative design by designer. In this study, 30 students with interactive VR teaching needs were collected to experiment to analyze the usability of three types of VR devices: original, AI design, and AI + designer design handles. The participants were asked to operate the three VR devices, and after completing the tasks set in the experiment through the VR devices, the participants were asked to fill out the SUS scale to evaluate the usability. The results show that the usability of the AI + designer- designed devices is higher than that of the original and AI design devices, reaching statistical significance.

"The rise of digital platforms makes it increasingly challenging for developers to manage the growing number of user reviews. Replying to each review manually is time-consuming, and template responses often fail to deliver personalized and natural responses. With this challenge, we explore the use of generative AI models that can generate contextually appropriate and personalized responses by learning from data through fine-tuning. This allows for greater variety in responses, avoiding the repetition of static templates. In this study, we evaluated three lightweight and publicly available models: T5-small, FLAN-T5-small, and BART-base, for comparison. These models were chosen for their ability to achieve strong performance while being computationally efficient, which is particularly important when working with moderate-sized datasets. The dataset used consists of 10,000 review-response pairs scraped from Spotify and the Google Play Store and is split into training, validation, and test sets with an 80-10-10 ratio. Our results show that T5-small achieved the highest scores in automatic evaluation metrics, with a BLEU-1 score of 0.5095, a BLEU-4 score of 0.3344, and a ROUGE-L score of 0.4606. However, human evaluations revealed that BART-base outperformed the others in fluency, relevance, and accuracy, scoring 4.37, 3.73, and 4.03, respectively. FLAN-T5-small without instructions also performed well, while its performance with instructions was notably lower, highlighting the importance of prompt design in generative AI models. These findings underscore the challenges of deploying generative AI at scale and emphasize the importance of integrating automated metrics with human insights to generate contextually relevant and natural responses.","Hanestan, Fanes; Wulandhari, Lili Ayu",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICoDSA67155.2025.11157547,yi4mzy3msn,,,,"2025 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA), Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA), 2025 International Conference on",,727,722,,True,20250703,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Measurement; Hands; Training; Accuracy; Reviews; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Oral communication; Data models; Reliability; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>ai</mark>; review response; text generation; evaluation; paraphrasing",Generative AI Models for Automated User Review Feedback on Digital Platforms,

"In the context of cloud-native architecture, the need for an efficient autoscaling mechanism is crucial to ensure service availability while avoiding resource waste. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes has limitations in responding to real-time load spikes. This research aims to develop a prediction-based autoscaling approach using the Claude 3.7 Sonnet generative AI model via Amazon Bedrock. Historical CPU and memory data were collected by Prometheus at certain intervals, then converted to CSV format and sent to Claude 3.7 to generate a prediction of the number of pods needed in the next five minutes. The prediction results are then automatically applied to the Amazon EKS cluster via the Kubernetes API. The test results show that this approach can improve resource utilization efficiency and maintain service stability during traffic fluctuations, when compared to conventional HPA. This research also reveals that the accuracy of the prediction is highly dependent on the quality of the historical data, prompt, and AI model used. In the future, this research will expand the scope by adding other metrics such as latency, request rate, and I/O, and comparing the performance between generative AI models on Amazon Bedrock.","Ginarsa, Nyoman Agus Nugraha; Santoso, Bagus Jati",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICERA66156.2025.11087276,3usqkhjc5z,,,,"2025 4th International Conference on Electronics Representation and Algorithm (ICERA), Electronics Representation and Algorithm (ICERA), 2025 4th International Conference on",,404,400,,True,20250612,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Measurement; Fluctuations; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Predictive models; Prediction algorithms; Stability analysis; Real-time systems; Resource management; Thermal stability; Load modeling; autoscaling; Kubernetes; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Amazon Bedrock",Intelligent Kubernetes Autoscaling Through Generative AI-Driven Workload Predictions,

"In the era of artificial intelligence, the governance of false and harmful information in cyberspace has become more urgent due to the development of content generation technologies. Therefore, the monitoring techniques for false and harmful information has become an important research topic. The core principle of false and harmful information monitoring technology is the integration of content feature extraction and monitoring algorithms. Allowing the generation and dissemination of false and harmful information poses potential threats to social stability and the legitimate rights and interests of others. The technical reasons for the generation of false and harmful information are that the quality of training data sets affects the authenticity of output content, the capabilities of deep learning models accelerate the generation of false and harmful information, and the lag in the update of training data sets makes it difficult to detect false news in new contexts.

"Student attrition remains a significant challenge for higher education institutions, particularly during the freshman to sophomore year transition. This study introduces a comprehensive decision-support framework that integrates state-of-the-art predictive machine learning (ML) techniques, local ML explanation techniques, and Generative AI to enhance individualized intervention programs aimed at reducing freshman student attrition. Utilizing a dataset encompassing 13 years of enrollment data from a sizable US academic institution, we developed predictive models using deep neural networks to identify students at risk of leaving school with an overall accuracy of 86%. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was then used to enhance the transparency of the model by providing granular insights into the contribution of various factors to individual students' dropout risks. Notably, we employed Generative AI to translate SHAP scores into comprehensible and actionable intervention recommendations presented via an interactive decision-support dashboard. This dashboard aids school administrators in designing personalized support strategies for at-risk students at the individual level. By leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of Generative AI, our framework offers a novel approach to understanding and simulating human behavior in educational settings, emphasizing the importance of precise individual-level insights. This study bridges critical gaps in the literature by operationalizing advanced ML models and explainable AI tools to support decision-making processes in educational settings, ultimately aiming to enhance student success and institutional stability.","Davazdahemami, Behrooz; Delen, Altug H.; Delen, Dursun",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/23270012.2025.2486317,2y7um6hvtv,,,2,Journal of Management Analytics,,369,346,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=2y7um6hvtv&recordId=2y7um6hvtv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,"<mark>Artificial</mark> neural networks; Universities &amp; colleges; Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Machine learning; Student attrition",Generative AI-enhanced interventions: a novel framework for predicting and mitigating freshman student attrition.,12

"The application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in certain operations of the public sector has been viewed as a revolutionary use aiming at improving efficiency, resource management, and facilitating the implementation of modern governance through informed decisions backed by evidence. This research article looks at the ability of generative AI to transform the institution of public administration by dealing with the problems of waisted resources, improving accountability and increasing citizen participation. The areas of focus include efficiency of the administration, optimization of resources, Governance models based on data, barriers to adoption of AI, public engagement, Ethical issues. The research employs Therese as a methodology consisting of the integration of quantitative and qualitative forms to study the impact of generative AI on the structures of governance frameworks. The results offer an interesting insight as there is substantial evidence which suggests that users who believe there are efficiency improvements resulting from AI tools, are likely to use such tools (r=0.78, p&lt;0.01), which shows that AI tools can provide more efficiency in the processes and minimise delays that would otherwise be associated with bureaucracies. AI's capacity to anticipate how much resources would be needed and for how long resources can be optimally utilized is supported by example where there was a 20% reduction in urban development project budget wastage. In addition, AI provide raw data analytical inputs through their models which increases efficiency up to 35%, where this data was utilized to improve urban management. On the other hand, the research also reveals some other challenges such as lack of digital infrastructures, inadequately skilled workforce, and unenthusiastic attitude towards innovations that are crucial for scaling the usage of AI. These challenges should be addressed mainly through strategic approaches such as embarking on capacity building and partnerships with private organizations to provide joint Services.","NICA, Elvira; POPESCU, Gheorghe; GRUPAC, Marian; HURJUI, Marcela Cristina; PÂRVU, Ioana Alexandra",Business Source Ultimate,,,7kghnnhpen,,,2,Management Research &amp; Practice,,56,35,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=7kghnnhpen&recordId=7kghnnhpen&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Academia de Studii Economice,Public sector; Economic efficiency; Organizational governance; Resource allocation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Political participation; Ethical problems,"REVOLUTIONIZING PUBLIC SECTOR OPERATIONS WITH GENERATIVE AI: ENHANCING EFFICIENCY, OPTIMIZING RESOURCES, AND EMPOWERING DATA-DRIVEN DECISION-MAKING FOR MODERN GOVERNANCE.",17

"At the age of intelligent design, generative AI tools are leading to a revolution in visual communication as the creative process is shifting to being fully automated, ideation is augmented, and production pipelines are fast-tracked. This paper will present a robust multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to analyze the comparative efficiency of prevalent tools of generative AI based on the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) approach in an interval-valued (IVSF) spherical fuzzy framework. The IVSF framework is used to faithfully reflect the differences in how much or how little an expert would like to assign a particular degree of membership, non-membership, or abstinence, for the interval-valued membership, non-membership, and abstinence of degrees. These IVSF values are summed up, defuzzified, and then combined in the CoCoSo algorithm to provide an overall rating of the alternatives. One of the key features of this writing is the creation of a practical case study based on seven assessment criteria, including creativity, cost, customization, integration capability, and others, as well as ten generative AI platforms. DeepArt is presented as the most relevant tool by the proposed IVSF-CoCoSo approach, as it achieves a higher rate of creativity improvement, yields the best results in terms of output quality, and offers customization. Through comparison with other MCDM approaches, as well as sensitivity analysis, the proposed model proves to be highly reliable and flexible. The proposed study will provide practical knowledge to designers, researchers, and other industry stakeholders who aim to implement generative AI in visual communication processes successfully.","Sun, Huiying; Liu, Shunli",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1038/s41598-025-18506-9,75qwuappzr,,,1,Scientific Reports,,19,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=75qwuappzr&recordId=75qwuappzr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251006,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Multiple criteria decision making; Visual communication; Fuzzy sets; Creative ability; Design software,Evaluating generative AI tools for visual communication design using the CoCoSo method under interval valued spherical fuzzy environment.,15
"Since its articulation in 2009, Computational Social Science (CSS) has grown into a mature interdisciplinary paradigm, shaped first by mobile media-generated digital traces and more recently by generative AI. With over a decade of development, CSS has expanded its scope across data, methods, and theory: data sources have evolved from mobile traces to multimodal records; methods have diversified from surveys and experiments to agent-based modeling, network analysis, and computer vision; and theory has advanced by revisiting classical questions and modeling emergent digital phenomena. Generative AI further enhances CSS through scalable annotation, experimental design, and simulation, while raising challenges of validity, reproducibility, and ethics.

Unlike traditional artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, GAI and LLMs possess powerful self-learning, data-modeling, and context-aware capabilities. Specifically, GAI can extract deep features and semantic information from large amounts of data, which allows it to make intelligent predictions and optimize processes for a flexible response to changes in complex environments. Moreover, by simulating network behaviors under different scenarios and generating new data points, GAI can optimize network architecture and expand training datasets to improve model robustness and generalization. Additionally, LLMs can rapidly adapt to diverse tasks through a few-shot learning. Furthermore, they can incorporate techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), thereby strengthening their capacity to handle complex text-based tasks and achieve precise information generation and intelligent interaction.","Sun, G.; Dobre, O.A.; Ksentini, A.; Niyato, D.; Wu, W.; Wang, J.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/LNET.2025.3613807,pmqv7lzmzj,,,3,"IEEE Networking Letters, Networking Letters, IEEE, IEEE Netw.

A comprehensive data survey involved 206 respondents from various academic and professional backgrounds. The survey explored the factors influencing the use and acceptance of GenAI tools within educational contexts. To analyze the data and predict user behavior and usage patterns, a machine learning algorithm random forest regressor, was utilized using Python. Firstly, the composite artificial intelligence adoption index has been developed to investigate how individuals adopt and integrate GenAI into their routine academic usage. Secondly, three thematic dimensions of GenAI usage have been identified as cognitive benefit score, writing benefit score, and information benefit score, which are presumed to be the most important part of AIAI. Furthermore, Pearson correlation coefficient and heat map, along with statistical p-value significance, were generated to understand the association among the AI adoption index and the three thematic dimensions. There exists strong evidence that perceived cognitive benefits are the primary drivers of AI adoption, followed by writing and information gathering benefits.

"The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is reshaping engineering education. This study explores engineering students’ perceptions of the use of GAI tools to support their learning, focusing on three dimensions: 1) perceived ease of use and usefulness, 2) personalization, interactivity, and confidence, and 3) perceived intelligence and intention to adopt. A descriptive quantitative design was employed, involving 66 BSc and MSc engineering students from a Portuguese university who responded to a 49-item survey. The survey was designed ad hoc by the authors, drawing on recent instruments developed to assess higher education students’ perceptions of GAI use and adoption for learning (e.g., TAME-ChatGPT). Overall results show that students find GAI intuitive and beneficial for learning. However, they also recognize the importance of asking good questions and that these tools can dampen creativity and critical thinking. On the one hand, students are optimistic and inclined to adopt them; on the other hand, they voice ethical and reliability concerns (e.g., information credibility, over-reliance, plagiarism). These findings underscore the need for carefully designed, well-founded integration strategies that can both maximize the potential of GAI tools and minimize their pitfalls.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered a progressive neurogenerative disorder that highly impacts elder people. Gradually this disease results in memory loss, poor thinking capacity, and overall cognitive decline. Nevertheless, various traditional works recommend that the pathological variations present in the brain happen decades prior to the initial clinical signs appearing. The implementation of cost-effective and noninvasive approaches to identify AD is significant for its timely mitigation as well as prevention. Therefore, in this article, an advanced generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided AD detection approach is designed using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which are helpful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression very effectively. The EEG signals required for the identification of AD are collected from benchmark sources and are applied as the input to the ShortTerm Fourier Transform (STFT) for spectrogram image conversion. The AD detection is done using the proposed Attention-based Generative Adversarial Network (A-GAN), which produces the most desirable detection outcomes by classifying the input STFT images. The classification results are compared with the baseline AD detection approaches to validate the performance of the designed technique using various measures. The developed model supports earlier detection and provides highly more effective treatment interventions.","Ravikanti, Dileep Kumar; Saravanan, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICDICI66477.2025.11135201,ypdfft672b,,,,"2025 6th International Conference on Data <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Cognitive Informatics (ICDICI), Data <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Cognitive Informatics (ICDICI), 2025 6th International Conference on",,406,400,,True,20250709,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Pathology; Fourier transforms; Accuracy; Prevention and mitigation; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Brain modeling; Reliability engineering; Electroencephalography; Alzheimer's disease; Spectrogram; Alzheimer's Disease Detection; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Electroencephalogram Signals; Short-term Fourier Transform; Attention-based <mark>Generative</mark> Adversarial Network",Artificial Intelligence-Driven Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection Framework from EEG Signals Through Attention-Based Generative Adversarial Network,
"Deep learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has grown quickly and is now widely used in computer software. As the need for deep learning algorithms that can handle more complicated tasks keeps growing very quickly, the improvements in how efficient and productive these algorithms can be utilized for identifying data poisoning is an important step. Data poisoning refers to altering the legitimate data using various techniques and fabricating the expected results. The poisoning will affect the quality of predictions and reliability of the contents generated. The data sensitive applications which rely on classification models for deriving conclusions will be affected by poisoning resulting in unrealistic conclusions and misguided inferences. Continuous occurrence of poorly classified data and unrealistic conclusions will affect the reliability of the system making it less trustworthy. This research looks into long lasting effects of poisoning attacks, which target the training data used in deep learning and assess the way a deep learning model classifies information. Experiments were done to measure the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in effectively detecting poisoned data. The evaluations were done using KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression models. The analysis concludes that KNN offers better prediction compared to SVM and Logistic Regression. Logistic regression offers less accurate predictions making it unfit for poisoning detection. Proper classification of poisoned data will help research community and users to be aware of legitimacy of data and thereby help them to choose the right data and information for processing, analytics, and deriving conclusions. This will greatly improve the performance and trustworthiness of related models including generative AI systems and makes the learning process un biased which will highly benefit the research community in general.","Thomas, Priya; Asha, V.; Diman, Diksha; MB, Yashwanth; Pandey, Vishal; J, Arun",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICDICI66477.2025.11135090,ub22oyfnaz,,,,"2025 6th International Conference on Data <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Cognitive Informatics (ICDICI), Data <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Cognitive Informatics (ICDICI), 2025 6th International Conference on",,202,197,,True,20250709,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Deep learning; Logistic regression; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Soft sensors; Software algorithms; Training data; Nearest neighbor methods; Reliability; Random forests; Data Poisoning; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; un-biased learning; Intrusion Detection System (IDS); K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN); Random Forest",Safeguarding Creativity: The Impacts and Countermeasures of Data Poisoning in Generative AI Systems,

"Generative AI technologies have revolutionized animation production, yet their adherence to the foundational principles of animation remains underexplored. This study evaluates the extent to which AI-generated animations align with the ten fundamental principles defined by Thomas and Johnston. Five animations were systematically analyzed through expert evaluations and statistical methods, including inter-rater reliability, chi-square tests, factor analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and logistic regression. The results revealed that while principles such as Staging, Solid Drawing, and Appeal were consistently adhered to, dynamic motion-related principles like Squash and Stretch, Anticipation, and Exaggeration were entirely absent. For intermediate principles like Timing and Follow-Through were variable, it shows the constraints of AI's ability to reproduce temporal motion control. This research contributes to the animation field by providing an analysis of the animation principles in AI-generated animation, identifying both strengths and weaknesses. Practical significance highlights the potential for hybrid workflows wherein AI is employed for static composition tasks, and nuanced motion design is reserved for human animators. The results enable the development of generative artificial intelligence technologies, and the necessity for models capable of grasping the artistry and sophistication involved in conventional animation is now clear. The study presents actionable guidance to researchers, developers, and practitioners interested in closing the gap between technological advancement and artistic design.","Izani, M.; Gabr, Mona; Razak, A.; Kaleel, Akhmed",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TENSYMP63728.2025.11145008,akegop54vj,,,,"2025 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP), Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP), 2025 IEEE",,7,1,,True,20250707,IEEE,"Aerospace; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Visualization; Art; Systematics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Animation; Solids; Remote working; Timing; Motion control; Analysis of variance; Animation Principles; <mark>AI</mark>-Generated Animations; Temporal Motion Control; Hybrid Workflows",A Principle-Based Evaluation of Generative AI Animation,
"This study focuses on the application of generative artificial intelligence in the field of cultural creation and communication, and proposes an innovative multimodal fusion generative adversarial network algorithm (MM-GAN). The algorithm effectively integrates multimodal cultural data such as text, image, and audio by constructing a cultural feature fusion module, a dynamic adversarial training mechanism, and a semantic consistency constraint module. The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.","Wang, Chen",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICIPCA65645.2025.11138882,7hg76f725b,,,,"2025 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Image Processing and Computer Applications (ICIPCA), Image Processing and Computer Applications (ICIPCA), 2025 IEEE 3rd International Conference on",,1801,1796,,True,20250628,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Deep learning; Vocabulary; Visualization; TV; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Heuristic algorithms; Semantics; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Cultural differences; Global communication; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; cultural creation; deep learning; multimodal fusion <mark>generative</mark> adversarial network; experimental simulation",Research on Deep Learning of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Cultural Creation and Communication,

In this context, an architectural framework is proposed for retinal image generation in diabetic retinopathy. The generated images are subjected to a systematic clinical validation process conducted by ophthalmologists to assess their alignment with the clinical manifestations of diabetic retinopathy and enhance their applicability in pathology analysis. The dataset used for training, testing, and validating the generative model must possess an adequate volume and a balanced class distribution. High visual quality and accurate representation of the morphological features specific to each stage of diabetic retinopathy are fundamental elements for achieving the targeted outcomes.

"The remarkable capacity of generative large language models such as GPTs, to generate high-quality content in a variety of fields that nearly mimics human writing has garnered attention in recent years, posing significant problems in differentiation. Consequently, it is now more important than ever to detect machine-generated text. PAN 2024 organizes a competition for differentiating the text written by human or machine. They provided the dataset of human writings and machine generated texts. In this work, we developed a hybrid model for predicting whether the text was generated by the human or a machine. The proposed model integrates the stylistic features and embeddings from two sophisticated transformer models, such as RoBERTa and T5 models. The PAN 2024 Generative AI Authorship Verification dataset is used in this experiment. The dataset contains files of concepts that are written by humans and different large language models. In the proposed model, the files are represented as vectors by combining the stylistic features based vector representation and word embedding techniques based vector representation. These vectors are forwarded to LightGBM algorithm for training. The performance of proposed model represented in terms of numerous evaluation metrics such as ROC-AUC, C@1, Brier, F0.5u, F1, and mean.

"Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) is dramatically changing the healthcare sector through improved diagnosis and streamlined administrative processes. Gen-AI technologies meet these needs in the face of mounting pressures arising from cost levels, patient expectations, and the pressure for more individualised treatment. It can identify trends by analysing large datasets, such as electronic health records and imaging data, allowing for trend recognition and providing clinical decision support, thereby improving the quality of both patient care and operational efficiency. Despite the promise that Gen-AI presents, there are inherent risks associated with integrating Gen-AI into healthcare. These include issues regarding data privacy, biases in algorithms, and lack of appropriate frameworks for ethical decision-making. Governance structures can ensure compliance with privacy regulations and enhance user trust. Ongoing evaluations are also necessary about Gen-AI and its impact on clinical outcomes to maximize benefits and minimize risks. The end-to-end solutions that would be developed using Gen-AI include automated report generation and facial recognition to reduce administrative burdens and improve patient experiences.

"The rapid adoption of Generative AI across multiple use cases has introduced new risks and attack surfaces across a range of important applications. While the increasing competency of Large Language Models (LLMs) promises high value, responsible AI requires the mitigation of potentially biased, brittle, and baroque operations which undermine trust and carry the potential of causing harm. Moreover, active adversaries will exploit LLM weaknesses to undermine confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Encompassing a survey of current LLM performance and risk literature, this paper presents a framework for understanding the current state of the art and a complementary path forward. In particular, the framework enables designers, users, and policymakers to understand and assess categorized risks and suggests methods to mitigate weaknesses during design and deployment in order to create LLMs that are less likely to fail and more resilient to attacks. It also suggests methods to use existing but imperfect LLMs in a responsible manner.","Maybury, Mark",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICAD65464.2025.11114038,revggbvgvf,,,,"2025 IEEE International Conference on <mark>AI</mark> and Data Analytics (ICAD), <mark>AI</mark> and Data Analytics (ICAD), 2025 IEEE International Conference on",,7,1,,True,20250624,IEEE,Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Surveys; Data analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Prevention and mitigation; Large language models; Security; Resilience; LLM; vulnerability; security; resilience,"Mitigating Biased, Brittle and Baroque Generative AI",
"AbstractGenerative AI (GAI) holds transformative potential for supply chain management (SCM) by improving efficiency, minimising inefficiencies, and advancing sustainability. Yet, its adoption remains hindered by complex barriers spanning technological, ethical, regulatory, and organisational domains. This study applies the Technology-Organisation-Environment-Human (TOEH) framework to classify these barriers and utilises the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method to explore their interdependencies. Expert insights reveal that human-centric obstacles—such as workforce resistance and skill deficits—are primarily rooted in gaps in technological readiness, regulatory clarity, and organisational alignment. Ethical concerns, financial limitations, and conflicting strategic priorities further exacerbate these challenges. The findings underscore the need for a comprehensive strategy encompassing AI ethics, regulatory harmonisation, and structured management change. This study contributes actionable insights by promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, robust data governance, and enhanced explainability, enabling organisations to overcome resistance and unlock the full potential of GAI in fostering resilient, adaptive, and sustainable supply chains.","Maghroor, Hamid Reza; Madanchi, Faraz; O’Neal, Thomas",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/09537287.2025.2561967,m3slzvy6jv,,,,Production Planning &amp; Control,,20,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=m3slzvy6jv&recordId=m3slzvy6jv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251001,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Supply chain management; Decision making; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Interdisciplinary research; Sustainability; Ethical problems,Leveraging Generative AI for sustainable supply chain: adoption challenges and strategic insights.,
"Most aerospace turbine casings are mechanised using a vertical lathe. This paper presents a tool wear monitoring system using computer vision that analyses tool inserts once that the machining process has been completed. By installing a camera in the robot magazine room and a tool cleaning device to remove chips and cooling residuals, a neat tool image can be acquired. A subsequent Deep Learning (DL) model classifies the tool as acceptable or not, avoiding the drawbacks of alternative computer vision algorithms based on edges, dedicated features etc. Such model was trained with a significantly reduced number of images, in order to minimise the costly process to acquire and classify images during production. This could be achieved by introducing a special lens and some generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This paper proposes two novel architectures: SCWGAN-GP, Scalable Condition Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Gradient Penalty, and Focal Stable Diffusion (FSD) model, with class injection and dedicated loss function, to artificially increase the number of images to train the DL model. In addition, a K|Lens special optics was used to get multiple views of the vertical lathe inserts as a means of further increase data augmentation by hardware with a reduced number of production samples. Given an initial dataset, the classification accuracy was increased from 80.0 % up to 96.0 % using the FSD model. We also found that using as low as 100 real images, our methodology can achieve up to 93.3 % accuracy. Using only 100 original images for each insert type and wear condition results in 93.3 % accuracy and up to 94.6 % if 200 images are used. This accuracy is considered to be within human inspector uncertainty for this use-case. Fine-tuning the FSD model, with nearly 1 billion training parameters, showed superior performance compared to the SCWGAN-GP model, with only 80 million parameters, besides of requiring less training samples to produced higher quality output images. Furthermore, the visualization of the output activation mapping confirms that the model takes a decision on the right image features. Time to create the dataset was reduced from 3 months to 2 days using generative AI. So our approach enables to create industrial dataset with minimum effort and significant time speed-up compared with the conventional approach of acquiring a large number of images that DL models usually requires to avoid over-fitting. Despite the good results, this methodology is only applicable to relatively simple cases, such as our inserts where the images are not complex.","Garcia-Perez, Alberto; Gomez-Silva, Maria Jose; de la Escalera-Hueso, Arturo",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1007/s10845-024-02379-2,35fxhkky6b,,,5,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,,3183,3165,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=35fxhkky6b&recordId=35fxhkky6b&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Springer Nature,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Transformer models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Stable Diffusion; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Computer vision,A Generative AI approach to improve in-situ vision tool wear monitoring with scarce data.,36
"This tutorial discusses how large language models (LLMs) can transform data analytics instruction. It details innovative ways to blend AI into classes, from turning problem sets into AI tutoring sessions to crafting AI-driven group activities. This tutorial addresses the challenge of incorporating large language models, such as ChatGPT, in a data analytics class. It details several new in-class and out-of-class teaching techniques enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Here are three examples. Instructors can parallelize instruction by having students interact with different custom-made GPTs to learn different parts of an analysis and then teach each other what they learned from their GPTs. Instructors can turn problem sets into AI tutoring sessions: a custom-made GPT guides a student through the problems and the student uploads the chatlog for their homework submission. Instructors can assign different labs to each section of a class and have each section create AI assistants to help the other sections work through their labs. This tutorial advocates the natural language programming (NLP) paradigm, in which students articulate desired data transformations with a spoken language, such as English, and then use AI to generate the corresponding computer code.

"In many general education classrooms across the world, educators struggle to meet the educational needs of twice-exceptional and multi-exceptional neurodivergent learners, with their confluence of exceptional strengths and exceptional challenges. This article reports the process, findings, and implications of research that implemented a series of small-scale experiments conducted by two neurodivergent researchers and one neurotypical researcher in collaboration with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) large language models (LLM). These experiments explored and developed human-centered, GenAI-informed approaches for teachers to rehearse pedagogy for these students. Using evidence-informed fictional, synthetic learner profiles (synthetic research participants), the researchers explored how GenAI could support educators in rehearsing pedagogy for multi-exceptional students through targeted prompting and design of personalized learning approaches. Findings reveal some potentially promising implications for GenAI application in generating adaptive, personalized educational approaches. The findings demonstrate the possibility for using GenAIs to understand and address the complex needs of these learners, offering potentially innovative solutions for educators. However, the study also identified challenges in ensuring consistent, context-appropriate, and unbiased outputs, underscoring the necessity of human oversight.

"In collaborative systems with complex tasks relying on distributed resources, trust evaluation of potential collaborators has emerged as an effective mechanism for task completion. However, due to the network dynamics and varying information gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and collect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a comprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust evaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of misaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task completion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages based on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion process, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant to that stage—leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By leveraging advanced incontext learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning capabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the collected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices deemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation. The framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy in trust evaluation.","Zhu, B.; Wang, X.; Zhang, L.; Shen, X.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MNET.2025.3582407,vcpe5y2yon,,,5,"IEEE Network, Network, IEEE",,50,44,,True,20250901,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Collaboration; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Security; Cognition; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Accuracy; Training; Reliability; Complexity theory; Servers; Collaborative system; LLM; Trust evaluation",Chain-of-Trust: A Progressive Trust Evaluation Framework Enabled by Generative AI,39
"The Internet of Health Monitoring (IoHM) plays a vital role in emergency medical package delivery (EMPD) by enabling real-time monitoring and transmission of critical health data through interconnected devices in 6G networks. Autonomous aerial vehicles (UAVs) act as aerial base stations (ABSs), facilitating data collection and transmission between GAI-IoHM devices and edge servers. This is crucial for efficient communication in 6G-enabled space-air–ground integrated networks (SAGINs). However, UAVs supporting EMPD face challenges related to limited energy and computational capacity, especially during task offloading to edge servers. To address these constraints, this article proposes the integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into UAVs for intelligent policy learning, enabling adaptive decision-making, real-time diagnostics, and efficient path planning under uncertainty. We present a novel multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based joint optimization framework for cooperative task allocation, trajectory planning, and power management (CTATP) in a 6G-enabled SAGIN architecture. The problem is modeled as a partially observable markov decision process (POMDP) to capture dynamic and uncertain operational conditions. To solve this, we introduce the GAI-based deep deterministic double policy gradient (GAI-DD3PG) algorithm, which leverages a generative actor-network to learn adaptive, energy-efficient control policies from latent action spaces. Simulations in urban emergency scenarios with 10–20 UAVs demonstrate GAI-DD3PG’s efficacy. Compared to proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), multiagent federated reinforcement learning (MAFRL), and Greedy heuristics, GAI-DD3PG achieves a 20% energy reduction, 15% higher delivery success rate, 25% shorter trajectories, and 30% improved resource utilization. These results highlight its potential for reliable EMPD in complex 6G SAGIN environments.","Leranso Betalo, M.; Ullah, I.; Berhanu Tesema, F.; Wu, Z.; Li, J.; Bai, X.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JIOT.2025.3579780,bxzqrhtuhb,,,17,"IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, IEEE Internet Things J.",,35907,35890,,True,20250901,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Resource management; 6G mobile communication; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Real-time systems; Wireless sensor networks; Reliability; Energy efficiency; Adaptation models; Space-air-ground integrated networks; Optimization; Energy-efficient autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) operation; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (GAI); multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL); power optimization; space-air–ground integrated network; trajectory",Generative AI-Driven Multiagent DRL for Task Allocation in UAV-Assisted EMPD Within 6G-Enabled SAGIN Networks,12
"The rapid convergence of generative AI (GAI), neuro-symbolic reasoning, and quantum computing has redefined secure communication and networking. Owing to the massive amounts of data, the need for extensive computing power, and the necessity to find and mitigate threats in real-time, traditional security measures cannot keep up with changing cyber threats as the communication infrastructure becomes more complicated. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential of a GAI-enhanced neuro-symbolic quantum framework for building security systems that are strong, scalable, and self-sufficient. This method improves threat detection, encryption, and real-time adversarial defense by combining symbolic reasoning for logic, deep learning for pattern recognition, and quantum intelligence to accelerate computations.

"Leukemia is a cancer originating in the bone marrow and leads to rapid proliferation of abnormal blood cells. The main objective of this study is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify leukemia from microscopic cell images. The proposed framework combines a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates synthetic images of healthy cells to address class imbalance and training on a balanced leukemia dataset, with four different CNN architectures (InceptionV3, ResNet50, EfficientNetB3 and InceptionV4) - the effectiveness of this approach is validated on a Breast Cancer tumor dataset consisting of ultrasound images. Unlike prior studies that rely on standard augmentation, our approach incorporates synthetic image quality metrics (FID, IS, SSIM) to validate realism and structural fidelity.The results reveal GAN architecture achieving 16% higher performance on cell images compared to tumor images. Additionally, results obtained for each model were 76%, 80%, 75%, and 75% respectively, with RestNet50 attaining the best result.

"The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, has introduced various opportunities and challenges that must be addressed for its full potential to be realized in higher education. This study investigates the challenges associated with using GenAI tools in Omani higher education institutions (HEIs) from the perspective of both students and academics. Survey data was collected from 1,749 students and 450 academics across different universities in Oman. The main findings indicate that although both groups recognize issues like logical errors, bias and misleading information, lack of citation accuracy, facilitating cheating, dependency and reduced critical thinking, academics rated challenges slightly higher across all statements, especially on concerns about over-reliance on GenAI and concerns about facilitating cheating in exams or assignments. These findings indicate a significant concern among academics and students about over-reliance on GenAI, which may potentially diminish students’ ability to think critically and creatively, and increase students’ intellectual independence on ChatGPT. Despite these reservations on GenAI use, there is a general positive attitude of both students and academics for the adoption of GenAI in the higher education context, indicating a high level of readiness among both groups to explore GenAI's potential benefits, with an acknowledgment that regulatory frameworks may be necessary to address its potential drawbacks.

"Mental health issues are increasing worldwide, making early detection and timely intervention increasingly critical. This project introduces a two-step system that uses deep learning and generative AI to both detect and respond to signs of mental distress. In the first phase, a hybrid BERT-LSTM model classifies social media posts into mental health categories such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and BPD. To improve accuracy, the system uses a novel technique called Meaning Retention Pipelined Preprocessing, which retains important parts of the original message — like emojis, slang, and punctuation — to better understand the full meaning behind the text. In the second phase, a Generative AI model rewrites flagged posts, making the content more supportive and less emotionally triggering, while still keeping the original intent. Performance is measured using custom metrics such as Semantic Meaning Retention Accuracy and Sentiment Compound Score, both of which validate the advantages of the proposed preprocessing method. The framework provides a holistic solution that not only detects distress but also promotes a healthier digital environment and integrates actionable resources such as helpline numbers, giving users direct access to support.","Sweetlin, J.

GenAI agents were developed using a Performer-based deep learning architecture to identify errors in students' object-oriented programming (OOP) code. Nineteen participants were involved in a randomized block experiment evaluating trust, cognitive load, and learning performance with two agents of different transparency levels. A paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed significant differences in trust and exam scores, indicating that transparency enhances trust and learning outcomes, though no substantial difference in cognitive load was found.

"Design of RF and mmWave circuits and electromagnetic (EM) structures is typically a designer experience-driven process, aided with time and resource-intensive simulations, iterative design methods, and ad-hoc optimization. The starting points of this process are some preselected parameterized templates that can limit the design space and achievable performance and functionalities. While there are templates that exist for simpler EM structures operable over a narrow range of frequencies (such as simple matching networks, symmetrical power dividers, etc.), for many structures that require more complex spectral responses, there are no set templates. This paper presents a generative AI approach toward rapid synthesis of arbitrary shaped EM structures with designer scattering parameters (S-parameters) utilizing a directed diffusion approach. While these models have been extremely successful in generating complex images, we show for the first time the diffusion model for synthesis of EM structures (represented as images), allowing search space of arbitrary shaped structures. Compared to traditional genetic algorithms, we demonstrate design convergence in seconds. Even compared with prior works with predictive AI models, generative AI approach reduces design time by at least $\sim 10$ times. Since diffusion models are known to unearth a much richer design space compared to generative adversarial networks and variational encoders, we believe that this can open up a new dimension for generative AI approaches towards EM and circuit synthesis.","Guo, Yingqing; Karahan, Emir Ali; Li, Zihao; Shao, Zijian; Zhang, Zaixi; Wang, Mengdi; Sengupta, Kaushik",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/IMS40360.2025.11103838,rkekwv3qyj,,,,"2025 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium - IMS 2025, Microwave Symposium - IMS 2025, 2025 IEEE/MTT-S International",,929,926,,True,20250615,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Photonics and Electrooptics; Radio frequency; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Noise; Diffusion models; Radiofrequency integrated circuits; Space exploration; Scattering parameters; Circuit synthesis; Millimeter wave communication; Integrated circuit modeling; design automation; diffusion models; filters; inverse design; machine learning; mmWave",Dall-EM: Generative AI with Diffusion Models for New Design Space Discovery and Target-To-Electromagnetic Structure Synthesis,
"This study explored the relationship between senior high school students' intentions to use generative AI (GenAI) tools and their actual usage, both for educational support and academic dishonesty. A cross-sectional, correlational, quantitative research design was employed, involving a sample of 367 students from a private senior high school in the Philippines. Data were collected using a researcher-developed survey questionnaire. To analyze group differences in students' behavioral intentions to use GenAI tools, the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used based on grade level, academic strand, and socio-economic status. Results indicated no statistically significant differences in intent across these demographic variables. Spearman’s correlation analysis was also used to assess the relationship between students’ intent to use GenAI tools and their actual usage.

"Generative AI is transforming the way people accomplish tasks, reshaping numerous industries and workflows. In this study, we focus on one of the most popular applications of generative AI: text-to-image generation, a technology that gained significant attention in 2021. Despite its popularity, even after three years, text-to-image generation remains less efficient and slower on edge devices like mobile phones compared to its web-based counterparts. This research investigates various model variations and analyzes the factors influencing inference speed in image generation. While Mobile Diffusion, though not yet commercially available, claims to achieve an impressive inference speed of 0.02 seconds, we explore whether architectural modifications and sampling techniques can further enhance performance without compromising image quality. Our findings indicate that adjustments to sampling operations, such as switching the scheduler from PNDMS to DDIM, resulted in a 6.57% increase in inference speed, albeit with a slight degradation in FID and CLIP scores. In contrast, architectural changes yielded significant improvements, achieving up to a 15.24% increase in speed while maintaining favorable results in FID and CLIP scores.","Pardesi, Sonal Deepak; Muntean, Cristina Hava; Simiscuka, Anderson Augusto",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/BMSB65076.2025.11165718,7io7pzwgh5,,,,"2025 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB), Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB), 2025 IEEE International Symposium on",,6,1,,True,20250611,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Image quality; Industries; Degradation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Image synthesis; Image edge detection; Text to image; Switches; Mobile handsets; Multimedia communication; GANs; text-to-image",Pixelating to the Edge: Generative AI Art on Edge Devices,

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), e.g., diffusion model is recognized as a promising paradigm for enhancing intelligent transportation systems in vehicular networks. However, the existing implementation of GAI in vehicular networks is limited due to the massive data requirements of GAI and the considerable resources for model training, particularly in distributed vehicular network environments. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling distributed collaborative training for GAI. Therefore, in this paper we present an FL-empowered diffusion model training scheme for vehicular networks. Specifically, first, a novel utility evaluation model based on local model training accuracy is designed to assess the contribution of each vehicle's local model. The interactions between the edge computing servers and vehicles are modeled using a Stackelberg game, while a non-cooperative game determines the optimal strategy among vehicles. To account for the heterogeneity of vehicles and the uncertainty of associated risks, we incorporate prospect theory (PT) to represent subjective utility. Afterward, a backward induction mechanism is devised to determine the Stackelberg equilibrium for deriving the optimal decisions of edge computing servers and vehicles. Finally, simulations are conducted to illustrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves the sum utility rate in comparison to other baseline schemes.","Jiang, Haoqing; Su, Zhou; Xu, Qichao; Qi, Yihao; Dai, Minghui; Fang, Dongfeng",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICC52391.2025.11161518,srd56rqf7f,,,,"ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on Communications, Communications, ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on",,541,536,,True,20250608,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Engineering Profession; Training; Uncertainty; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Federated learning; Computational modeling; Collaboration; Games; Diffusion models; Servers; Edge computing; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (GAI); vehicles network; federated learning (FL); Stackelberg game; prospect theory (PT)",Federated-Learning-Empowered Distribution Training for Generative Artificial Intelligence in Vehicular Networks,

"This paper proposes a business model utilizing generative AI to address the labor shortage issue in the food service industry. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the bankruptcy rate in the food service industry has risen significantly. It mainly comes from the fact that business managers often fail to identify the key aspects customers prioritize when choosing a restaurant. The failure prevents the managers from attracting customers. The paper leverages the attention mechanism employed in large language models to identify the aspects that capture customer attention. The attention mechanism indicates which parts of the descriptions in popular recipes receive high self-attention scores. The experimental results reveal that the words receiving high self-attention scores vary with review types. It indicates that the self-attention mechanism can identify the elements humans focus on.

"Accurate and timely prediction of epileptic seizures is critical for effective clinical intervention in epilepsy management. Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely utilized to capture neural patterns indicative of seizure activity, but traditional machine learning approaches often struggle with limited, imbalanced, and noisy EEG data. This study proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework for EEG signal augmentation and seizure prediction using the UCI Epileptic Seizure Dataset. The approach focuses on improving classification performance by generating synthetic EEG data to balance class distribution and enhance model generalization. After preprocessing steps, redundant column removal and Z-score normalization, the GAN architecture autonomously learns feature distributions and augments the dataset with realistic samples. Experimental results show that the GAN-enhanced model achieves superior accuracy (98.23%) compared to conventional models, including CNN (97.13%), DenseNet-LSTM (93.28%), Decision Tree (91.0%), and SVM (88.65%). This confirms the potential of generative AI in capturing complex EEG patterns and advancing automated, high-accuracy seizure prediction. Future work will focus on real-time integration, multi-channel EEG scaling, and clinical validation.","Rudrashetty, S M",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/SENNET64220.2025.11135971,4i4ak7h26f,,,,"2025 International Conference on Sensors and Related Networks (SENNET) Special Focus on Digital Healthcare(64220), Sensors and Related Networks (SENNET) Special Focus on Digital Healthcare, 2025 International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250724,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Photonics and Electrooptics; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Epilepsy; Machine learning; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Brain modeling; Electroencephalography; Real-time systems; Sensors; Noise measurement; EEG; UCI-Epileptic Seizure Dataset; Classification; <mark>Generative</mark> Adversarial Network (GAN)",Generative AI for EEG-Based Brain Signal Augmentation and Seizure Prediction,

"This paper proposes a personalized learning path optimization algorithm based on GAN (GAN-LP). The algorithm automatically generates customized learning paths for each learner through adversarial training of the generator and the discriminator, and dynamically adjusts the learning content and sequence according to personalized characteristics such as learning progress, learner interests, and abilities, thereby optimizing the learning effect. The GAN-LP algorithm generates learning paths that meet the learner's personalized needs through the generator, while the discriminator evaluates whether the path is effective, and then continuously optimizes the performance of the generator through adversarial training. Using a real English learning dataset (including learners' historical scores, behavioral data, and learning progress), this paper compares GAN-LP with traditional rule-based learning path generation methods and algorithms based on recommendation systems. Experimental results show that GAN-LP is superior to other methods in terms of learning effect, learning efficiency, and learner satisfaction. Specifically, GAN-LP can improve learners' performance in terms of test scores and task completion time by about 20%, and improve learners' satisfaction by more than 15%. This study provides innovative ideas for the application of generative AI in the design of personalized learning paths, making full use of the generation and optimization capabilities of generative adversarial networks to improve the flexibility and adaptability of learning paths. This algorithm not only has broad application potential in the field of English learning, but also provides a feasible technical framework for the design of personalized learning paths in other fields.","Li, Hongxia; Liu, Yun",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICIPCA65645.2025.11138250,uiss3vgew5,,,,"2025 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Image Processing and Computer Applications (ICIPCA), Image Processing and Computer Applications (ICIPCA), 2025 IEEE 3rd International Conference on",,1114,1109,,True,20250628,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Technological innovation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Heuristic algorithms; Image processing; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Generators; Real-time systems; Optimization; Recommender systems; Personalized learning path; <mark>generative</mark> adversarial network; optimization algorithm; intelligent education; learning effect",Research on Optimization Algorithm of Generative AI in Design of Personalized Learning Path for English,
"Vibe coding is a recent Generative AI innovation where a human operator provides conversational natural language description of a problem and an AI assistant writes the code to develop a solution. It is more than collaborating or assisting with coding, as the entirety of coding and technical implementation is delegated to the AI agent. Vibe coding presents an immediate productivity boost for prototype development, as it addresses the growing complexity of development tools, increased demand for time-efficient prototype development, and the shortage of skills needed to address this demand. This paper presents the role and contribution of vibe coding for prototyping industrial systems. The paper begins with an introduction to vibe coding and vibe coding tools, followed by a workflow comparison of conventional prototyping and vibe coding worked through a sample scenario of an industrial system prototype. A further productivity comparison of the two approaches across diverse dimensions of cognitive load, development speed, code quality, debugging and iteration is also reported.

"The increasing realism of images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) presents new challenges for digital literacy, particularly in distinguishing authentic content from synthetic creations. This paper presents the results of a public online quiz in which participants were asked to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs. Each of the ten questions featured a pair of images—one original photograph and one AI-generated version created based on a textual description of the original. With over a hundred responses collected, the average score was 5.79 out of 10, with a median of 6, suggesting moderate success but also highlighting the difficulty many users had in discerning AI-generated content. The distribution of results showed a wide range of performance, with most participants scoring between 4 and 8 points. Some images were consistently misclassified, revealing patterns in human perception and AI-generated visual deception. These insights were used to design a workshop for high school and college students on AI in libraries, focusing on visual literacy and critical evaluation of digital media.

"6G's AI native vision of embedding advance intelligence in the network while bringing it closer to the user requires a systematic evaluation of Generative AI (GenAI) models on edge devices. Rapidly emerging solutions based on Open RAN (ORAN) and Network-in-aBox strongly advocate the use of low-cost, off-the-shelf components for simpler and efficient deployment, for example, in provisioning rural connectivity. In this context, conceptual architecture, hardware testbeds, and precise performance quantification of Large Language Models (LLMs) on off-theshelf edge devices remain largely unexplored. This research investigates computationally demanding LLM inference on a single commodity Raspberry Pi serving as an edge testbed for ORAN. We investigate various LLMs, including small, medium, and large models, on a Raspberry Pi 5 Cluster using a lightweight Kubernetes distribution (K3s) with modular prompting implementation. We study its feasibility and limitations by analyzing throughput, latency, accuracy, and efficiency. Our findings indicate that CPU-only deployment of lightweight models, such as Yi, Phi, and Llama3, can effectively support edge applications, achieving a generation throughput of 5 to 12 tokens per second with less than 50% CPU and RAM usage.

"This study investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated personalized images to address the underrepresentation of female students in university engineering programs and promote gender equality in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Persistent gender disparities in STEM present significant barriers to diversity and innovation, highlighting the need for innovative strategies to inspire underrepresented groups. The research involved 76 high school students from scientific tracks, who were shown with AI-generated personalized images portraying themselves working in STEM-related professions. Results indicate that self-envisioning in STEM fields increased for both genders after the intervention, with the effect being four times greater for female students. In engineering fields specifically, a significant increase in selfenvisioning was observed among female students, while no significant impact was found for male students-likely due to the historical underrepresentation of women and the influence of gender stereotypes on career aspirations.

"With the rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbots on e-commerce platforms, users' expectations for anthropomorphic service experiences have risen significantly. Despite the growing presence of GenAI, little is known about how different types of anthropomorphic users' self-efficacy and the intention to adopt as a decision aid through distinct cognitive pathways. Addressing this research gap, this study draws on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to develop a comprehensive framework that integrates central and peripheral cues. Using large-scale survey data from e-commerce users and structural equation modeling, the research empirically examines the mediating role of self-efficacy and the moderating effect of information overload. Results indicate that human-like empathy and perceived warmth (peripheral cues) and perceived competence (central cue) all significantly enhance self-efficacy, which in turn positively influences the intention to adopt as a decision aid. Moreover, information overload intensifies the effect of peripheral cues on self-efficacy but has a limited impact on central cues. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of GenAI–human interaction by clarifying the mechanisms through which anthropomorphic features operate, and provide actionable insights for designing user-centric GenAI recommendation services to optimize user experience and encourage the intention to adopt as a decision aid in e-commerce.","Li, Xiyang; Zhou, Tingfa; Hu, Chao; Liu, Haibin",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1038/s41598-025-18906-x,m2xuemubj5,,,1,Scientific Reports,,10,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=m2xuemubj5&recordId=m2xuemubj5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251008,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Information overload; Intention; Electronic commerce; Elaboration likelihood model; Self-efficacy; Recommender systems; Electronic Shopping; Electronic shopping and mail-order houses,The effects of the human-like features of generative AI on usage intention and the moderating role of information overload.,15

"This research examines the generative artificial intelligence's (AI) application systems on the analysis and reconstruction of architectural styles through the cultural integrity preservation lenses and design modification encouragement. The study constructs a framework for AI comprising feature extraction of architecture, semantic analysis and deep learning style diffusion reconstruction. The framework integrates historical and cultural contexts to evaluate architectural styles in three basic features domains: Assuming a multi-dimensional representation system of features architectural styles as developed structures assists in comprehension of the interrelations between architectural features. The research proposes and applies a new approach to semantic analysis directed towards understanding the construct description of an architectural style from a historical design preservation with a contemporary vision reinterpretation approach. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through case study investigations, comparative performance analysis, and expert appraisal, which attest to changes in style recognition up to 92.5% and design flexibility. Findings also prove that the AI digital tools design and modernisation integration with traditional architecture knowledge and skills facilitates the architectural heritage preservation while providing innovative design approaches.

"We study the problem of synthetic generation of samples of environmental features for autonomous vehicle navigation. These features are described by a spatiotemporally varying scalar field that we refer to as a threat field. The threat field is known to have some underlying dynamics subject to process noise. Some ""real-world"" data of observations of various threat fields are also available. The assumption is that the volume of ""real-world"" data is relatively small. The objective is to synthesize samples that are statistically similar to the data. The proposed solution is a generative artificial intelligence model that we refer to as a split variational recurrent neural network (S-VRNN). The S-VRNN merges the capabilities of a variational autoencoder, which is a widely used generative model, and a recurrent neural network, which is used to learn temporal dependencies in data. The main innovation in this work is that we split the latent space of the S-VRNN into two subspaces. The latent variables in one subspace are learned using the real-world data, whereas those in the other subspace are learned using the data as well as the known underlying system dynamics. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate that the proposed S-VRNN can synthesize data that are statistically similar to the training data even in the case of very small volume of real-world training data.","Bapat, Nachiket U.; Paffenroth, Randy C.; Cowlagi, Raghvendra V.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.23919/ECC65951.2025.11187032,r5b4yfefrb,,,,"2025 European Control Conference (ECC), Control Conference (ECC), 2025 European",,1363,1358,,True,20250624,EUCA,Robotics and Control Systems; Deep learning; Technological innovation; Recurrent neural networks; System dynamics; Navigation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Training data; Data models; Numerical models; Synthetic data,Synthetic Data Generation for Minimum-Exposure Navigation in a Time-Varying Environment using Generative AI Models,

"With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Static, human-curated approaches such as MITRE ATT&amp;CK and CAPEC are often insufficient for companies to implement effective countermeasures, and security experts frequently face challenges in integrating these frameworks into their specific architectures. In this paper, we explore the application of generative AI to organize and enhance cybersecurity knowledge bases. We leverage multiple state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment an initial dataset of attackmitigation pairs, generating new countermeasures along with their prioritized execution order in a reasonable time frame. To evaluate the generated responses, we employ the LLM-as-aJudge technique. Evaluations with Claude 3.5, DeepSeek R1, and human oversight show that top-performing models on general benchmarks also perform well in this specialized task, with more than 70% of responses rated 4 and 5 out of 5 for correctness, and the weaker models tend to perform the worst. Additionally, we discuss the challenges of running LLMs with a larger number of parameters on less powerful hardware, where the performance of such models can degrade significantly, even performing worse than their smaller counterparts. In such cases, advanced prompt engineering becomes necessary to improve results.

"The demand for high-quality synthetic data for model training and augmentation has never been greater in medical imaging. However, current evaluations predominantly rely on computational metrics that fail to align with human expert recognition. This leads to synthetic images that may appear realistic numerically but lack clinical authenticity, posing significant challenges in ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of AI-driven medical tools. To address this gap, we introduce GazeVal, a practical framework that synergizes expert eye-tracking data with direct radiological evaluations to assess the quality of synthetic medical images. GazeVal leverages gaze patterns of radiologists as they provide a deeper understanding of how experts perceive and interact with synthetic data in different tasks (i.e., diagnostic or Turing tests). Experiments with sixteen radiologists revealed that 96.6 % of the generated images (by the most recent state-of-the-art AI algorithm) were identified as fake, demonstrating the limitations of generative AI in producing clinically accurate images.","Wong, David; Wang, Bin; Durak, Gorkem; Tliba, Marouane; Chaudhari, Akshay; Chetouani, Aladine; Cetin, Ahmet Enis; Topel, Cagdas; Gennaro, Nicolo; Vendrami, Camila Lopes; Trabzonlu, Tugce Agirlar; Rahsepar, Amir Ali; Perronne, Laetitia; Antalek, Matthew; Ozturk, Onural; Okur, Gokcan; Gordon, Andrew C.; Pyrros, Ayis; Miller, Frank H.; Borhani, Amir; Savas, Hatice; Hart, Eric; Torigian, Drew; Udupa, Jayaram K.; Krupinski, Elizabeth; Bagci, Ulas",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CVPRW67362.2025.00299,64lr57bmxf,,,,"2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on, CVPRW",,3166,3158,,True,20250611,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; Robotics and Control Systems; Measurement; Training; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Medical services; Data models; Medical diagnostic imaging; Standards; Synthetic data; Data Quality Evaluation; Synthetic Data; Eye Tracking; Diffusion Model; Visual Turing Test",Eyes Tell the Truth: Gaze Val Highlights Shortcomings of Generative AI in Medical Imaging,

"Autism is the fastest-growing developmental condition, and as a spectrum disorder, individuals vary in severity in communication and behavior. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) presents opportunities to leverage such technology to support autistic individuals in multiple contexts, including education, healthcare, and disability research. However, very limited research has focused on developing AI or ML-based solutions for autistic individuals largely due to the scarcity of autism-related datasets. In order for autistic people to equally benefit from the breakthroughs in AI, the data representation gap in AI and ML must be addressed. The project proposes an innovative human expert and AI combined approach to generate synthetic data about autistic individuals. Through this approach, we are developing the first dataset of case studies of autistic individuals to effectively identify evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address the unique needs of autistic individuals. The project improves the representation and inclusion of autistic individuals in the rapidly evolving field of ML and AI through both methodological innovations (i.e., the expert/AI combined data generation approach) and practical contributions (i.e., the EBP dataset that will be made publicly accessible).

"The integration of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) into library systems is transforming the global information society, offering new possibilities for improving information access, management, and dissemination. However, these advancements also raise significant ethical concerns, including algorithmic bias, epistemic injustice, intellectual property conflicts, data privacy breaches, job displacement, the spread of misinformation, and increasing digital inequality. This review critically examines these challenges through the lens of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Action Line C10, which emphasizes the ethical dimensions of the information society. It argues that while such concerns are global, they are particularly acute in the Global South, where structural barriers such as skills shortages, weak policy frameworks, and limited infrastructure undermine equitable access to AI benefits. The review calls for a more inclusive, transparent, and ethically responsible approach to AI adoption in libraries. It underscores the essential role of libraries as stewards of ethical information practices and advocates for collaborative strategies to ensure that generative AI serves as a tool for empowerment, rather than a driver of deepening inequality in the information society.","Matsieli, Molefi; Mutula, Stephen",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/info16090771,e2pkk5g7rr,,,9,Information,,,771,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=e2pkk5g7rr&recordId=e2pkk5g7rr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250901,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Information society; Data privacy; Ethics; Libraries; Algorithmic bias; Digital divide; Libraries and Archives; Commercial and Institutional Building Construction; Libraries; Developing countries,Generative AI and the Information Society: Ethical Reflections from Libraries.,16

"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers the potential to enhance health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) by streamlining traditionally time-consuming and labour-intensive tasks, such as literature reviews, data extraction, and economic modelling. To effectively navigate this evolving landscape, health economists need a foundational understanding of how GenAI can complement their work. This primer aims to introduce health economists to the essentials of using GenAI tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), in HEOR projects. For health economists new to GenAI technologies, chatbot interfaces like ChatGPT offer an accessible way to explore the potential of LLMs. For more complex projects, knowledge of application programming interfaces (APIs), which provide scalability and integration capabilities, and prompt engineering strategies, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, is necessary to ensure accurate and efficient data analysis, enhance model performance, and tailor outputs to specific HEOR needs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can further improve LLM performance by incorporating current external information. LLMs have significant potential in many common HEOR tasks, such as summarising medical literature, extracting structured data, drafting report sections, generating statistical code, answering specific questions, and reviewing materials to enhance quality. However, health economists must also be aware of ongoing limitations and challenges, such as the propensity of LLMs to produce inaccurate information ('hallucinate'), security concerns, issues with reproducibility, and the risk of bias. Implementing LLMs in HEOR requires robust security protocols to handle sensitive data in compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the United States' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Deployment options such as local hosting, secure API use, or cloud-hosted open-source models offer varying levels of control and cost, each with unique trade-offs in security, accessibility, and technical demands. Reproducibility and transparency also pose unique challenges. To ensure the credibility of LLM-generated content, explicit declarations of the model version, prompting techniques, and benchmarks against established standards are recommended. Given the 'black box' nature of LLMs, a clear reporting structure is essential to maintain transparency and validate outputs, enabling stakeholders to assess the reliability and accuracy of LLM-generated HEOR analyses. The ethical implications of using artificial intelligence (AI) in HEOR, including LLMs, are complex and multifaceted, requiring careful assessment of each use case to determine the necessary level of ethical scrutiny and transparency. Health economists must balance the potential benefits of AI adoption against the risks of maintaining current practices, while also considering issues such as accountability, bias, intellectual property, and the broader impact on the healthcare system. As LLMs and AI technologies advance, their potential role in HEOR will become increasingly evident. Key areas of promise include creating dynamic, continuously updated HEOR materials, providing patients with more accessible information, and enhancing analytics for faster access to medicines. To maximise these benefits, health economists must understand and address challenges such as data ownership and bias. The coming years will be critical for establishing best practices for GenAI in HEOR. This primer encourages health economists to adopt GenAI responsibly, balancing innovation with scientific rigor and ethical integrity to improve healthcare insights and decision-making.","Reason, Tim; Klijn, Sven; Rawlinson, Will; Benbow, Emma; Langham, Julia; Teitsson, Siguroli; Johannesen, Kasper; Malcolm, Bill",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1007/s41669-025-00580-4,ix7bfziosb,,,4,PharmacoEconomics - Open,,517,501,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=ix7bfziosb&recordId=ix7bfziosb&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Springer Nature,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act; Language models; Hallucinations (<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>),Using Generative Artificial Intelligence in Health Economics and Outcomes Research: A Primer on Techniques and Breakthroughs.,9
"Autonomous driving object segmentation and detection training models generally rely on real-world data, which is costly to annotate, difficult to acquire, and heterogeneous. We present a new system based on deep learning and generative AI methods for producing high-quality synthetic data with the goal of overcoming these challenges. Our system produces photorealistic synthetic images using Stable Diffusion models and annotates them using the CVAT annotation tool and Segment Anything Model (SAM). We divide the obtained data into training sets and validation subsets upon pre-cleaning the given annotations into corresponding segmentation masks. We employ this dataset to train YOLOv8 on object detection and segmentation tasks in such a manner that we are able to check the quality of our produced fake data. In addition, we deploy the BLIP image-captioning feature on Salesforce to produce rich information-based descriptive product captions. Our models trained on our synthetic data are better, or even better, than models trained on real data, according to our experimental test. The test proves the huge potential of synthetic datasets as an economically sustainable and scalable way to train perception systems for autonomous vehicles, particularly for perceiving challenging or exotic driving situations.","Kumar, O.

"This study presents an automated approach to emotion detection and classification in informal text using SpaCy, with a focus on social media content such as tweets. The inherent brevity and colloquial nature of platforms like Twitter pose significant challenges for emotion analysis. To address this, the methodology incorporates web scraping of user reviews, each tagged with a unique identifier, and utilizes a Generative AI model to extract structured insights including dish names, ratings, pros, and cons in Markdown format. The analysis is conducted on the AIT-2018 dataset, enhanced with lexical resources such as WordNet-Affect and EmoSenticNet, enabling more nuanced emotion recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms traditional methods, particularly in handling short-form social media text.

"This Brief Paper discusses emerging trends from an ongoing study of how undergraduate engineering students at a midwest R1 university engage with Generative AI (GenAI) technologies and how these interactions influence their creative and ethical approaches to engineering work. Using survey data and interviews from fourteen students, initial findings reveal that students often began using GenAI experimentally, with the goals of having fun and testing its capabilities. In doing so, they unintentionally engage in the engineering practice of finding problems in need of solutions. This paper further examines students' ethical concerns related to authorship, accountability, and the ownership of ideas generated by GenAI. Although a human-in-the-loop approach is prevalent, where students critically incorporate GenAI into their learning, writing, and engineering practices, concerns around over-reliance and the ethical implications of GenAI's lack of personhood complicate their relationships with GenAI. This paper underscores the need for further exploration of ethics and creativity in GenAI use, as these novice engineers navigate the evolving network of technology in engineering education.","Krupansky, Mariel; Walker, Clay; Hart, Colleen",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ProComm64814.2025.00053,fd2ihqc2lj,,,,"2025 IEEE International Professional Communication Conference (ProComm), Professional Communication Conference (ProComm), 2025 IEEE International, PROCOMM",,243,239,,True,20250720,IEEE,Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Ethics; Uncertainty; Shape; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Writing; Market research; Chatbots; Interviews; Engineering students; Creativity; engineering communication; GenAI; ethics; personhood,"Do Chatbots Dream of Data Streams?

"In this paper, we propose a new adversarial training framework to address high-dimensional instantaneous channel estimation in wireless communications. Specifically, we train a generative adversarial network to predict a channel realization in the time-frequency-space domain, in which the generator exploits the third-order moment of the input in its loss function and applies a new reparameterization method for latent distribution learning to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the true and estimated channel distributions. Next, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence mechanism to examine how the critic discriminates the generated channel. We demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior to existing methods in terms of minimizing estimation errors. Additionally, we find that the critic's attention focuses on the high-power portion of the channel's time-frequency representation.","Nguyen, Nghia Thinh; Do, Tri Nhu",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICC52391.2025.11161627,gifj4r7prf,,,,"ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on Communications, Communications, ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on",,3784,3779,,True,20250608,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Engineering Profession; Training; Wireless communication; Time-frequency analysis; Estimation error; Explainable <mark>AI</mark>; 5G mobile communication; Channel estimation; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Generators; Data models; 5G NR; 3GPP; MIMO; VAE; WGAN-GP; Third-order moment",Generative and Explainable AI for High-Dimensional Channel Estimation,
"AI-Generated Content (AIGC) based on Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) is revolutionizing content creation and promoting substantial advancements in domains like autonomous driving and robotics. Leveraging progress in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and model compression techniques, GDMs are increasingly being deployed on Edge Servers (ESs) and User Equipments (UEs), which typically face resource limitations. In such MEC-enabled scenarios, designing an efficient inference scheme for GDMs still remains a significant challenge, due to the resource constraints on ESs and UEs as well as the personalized demands of AIGC users. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid inference scheme, which consists of two stages: public prompt generation and common-to-personalized inference. In the first stage, a Large Language Model (LLM) is adopted to generate public prompts derived from the common features of users' personal prompts. In the second stage, a common inference phase based on public prompts is first executed for all users (to produce common intermediate results), and then a personalized inference phase based on each user's personal prompts is performed for each individual user (to generate final contents). Clearly, by introducing the common inference phase, the total inference steps can be significantly reduced. In such a scheme, we further study a hybrid inference optimization problem to optimize both common and personalized inference steps, aiming to maximize the total Quality of Service (QoS), while minimizing delay and energy consumption. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, with the performance gains ranging from 12.6 % to 102.2 %.","Zhuang, Xinyi; Wu, Jiaqi; Wu, Hongjia; Tang, Ming; Gao, Lin",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICC52391.2025.11161497,xvg3jbvnvn,,,,"ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on Communications, Communications, ICC 2025 - IEEE International Conference on",,1156,1151,,True,20250608,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Engineering Profession; Energy consumption; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Simulation; Quality of service; Performance gain; Diffusion models; Hybrid power systems; Distance measurement; Delays; Optimization",QoS-Driven Hybrid Inference Scheme for Generative Diffusion Models in MEC-Enabled AI-Generated Content Networks,
"In mmWave wireless networks, signal blockages present a significant challenge due to the susceptibility to environmental moving obstructions. Recently, the availability of visual data has been leveraged to enhance blockage prediction accuracy in mmWave networks. In this work, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based approach for visual-aided blockage prediction that intelligently switches between mmWave and Sub-6 GHz frequencies to maximize network throughput and maintain reliable connectivity. Given the computational demands of processing visual data, we implement our solution within a hierarchical fog-cloud computing architecture, where fog nodes collaborate with cloud servers to efficiently manage computational tasks. This structure incorporates a generative AI-based compression technique that significantly reduces the volume of visual data transmitted between fog nodes and cloud centers.

"Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic technique that improves lesion visibility through the administration of an iodinated contrast agent. It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.","Rofena, Aurora; Manchia, Arianna; Piccolo, Claudia Lucia; Zobel, Bruno Beomonte; Soda, Paolo; Guarrasi, Valerio",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CBMS65348.2025.00039,5cipsxvon5,,,,"2025 IEEE 38th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS), Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS), 2025 IEEE 38th International Symposium on, CBMS",,146,141,,True,20250618,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Image segmentation; Visualization; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Pipelines; Breast cancer; Lesions; Standards; Image reconstruction; GANs; Cycle GAN; CESM; Breast Cancer; FFDM,Lesion-Aware Generative Artificial Intelligence for Virtual Contrast-Enhanced Mammography in Breast Cancer,

"Background: The rapid integration of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) into medical education offers significant opportunities for personalized learning, efficiency, and access. However, its implementation also raises complex ethical concerns that, if unaddressed, may compromise academic integrity, professional identity, and learner equity. This review aimed to identify the primary ethical risks associated with genAI use in medical education and propose solid measures to mitigate these issues. Methods: A structured narrative review was conducted in accordance with the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA). A focused literature search was performed across PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed, English-language articles published from January 2023 to May 2025. Studies were included if they addressed ethical issues in the use of genAI in undergraduate or postgraduate medical education. Data were extracted into related themes, and findings were synthesized into risk and mitigation categories. Results: A total of 27 records were included. Eight principal categories of ethical risks associated with genAI in medical education emerged: (1) academic integrity erosion, (2) cognitive deskilling, (3) algorithmic bias and opacity, (4) privacy and surveillance concerns, (5) moral and humanistic diminishment, (6) faculty role displacement, (7) commercialization and inequity, and (8) legal-regulatory ambiguity. Each risk was matched with targeted mitigation strategies proposed in the literature, including institutional genAI governance frameworks, genAI literacy training, reinforcement of humanistic pedagogy, establishment of ethical oversight bodies, curricular integration of ethical reflexivity, equity-centered implementation policies, faculty development for genAI integration, and transparent data governance protocols. Conclusion: Generative AI presents both transformative promise and substantial ethical risks in medical education. Proactive, ethically grounded integration - guided by institutional oversight, curriculum reform, and equity safeguards - is essential to realize its benefits while protecting the integrity and humanity of medical training.","Sallam, Malik; Sallam, Mohammed",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.53388/HPM2025020,d6cnorpl55,,,4,History &amp; Philosophy of Medicine,,14,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=d6cnorpl55&recordId=d6cnorpl55&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251001,TMR Publishing,"<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Medical education; Ethical problems; Education ethics; Privacy; Educational equalization; Curriculum change; Algorithmic bias; Educational Support Services; Administration of Education Programs; All Other Miscellaneous Schools and Instruction; Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools",Ethical aspects of implementing generative artificial intelligence in medical education: a narrative review.,7

"Automatic Question Generation (QG) is a cornerstone of digital learning systems, enabling scalable creation of engaging and pedagogically relevant questions. However, traditional approaches often suffer from issues such as contextual irrelevance, repetition, and lack of diversity in question formats. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel QG framework built on the LLaMA 3.1 language model, designed to generate three key types of questions: plain text, multiple-choice (MCQs), and fill-in-the-blank, each aligned with specific cognitive learning goals. Our methodology integrates optimized token handling and long-context management with advanced keyword extraction techniques, such as Sense2Vec and KeyBERT, and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to ensure semantic diversity and relevance, particularly in distractor generation for MCQs. Our system dynamically adapts question types to the input content, promoting active recall, comprehension, and analytical thinking. We evaluate our approach using automated metrics on the SQuAD 1.1 dataset. The model achieves an overall F1 score of 0.8, reflecting high alignment with reference questions in both lexical and semantic dimensions. These results demonstrate that our LLaMA 3.1-based framework generates high-quality educational questions that can be deployed in digital and blended learning environments.","Vedantham, Udayini; Chouti, Nithish; Kumar, Vishal; Mahatme, Geeta; Kundu, Debaditya; Ghosh, Krishnendu",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CIACON65473.2025.11189701,g7ay5z3mff,,,,"2025 International Conference on Computing, <mark>Intelligence</mark>, and Application (CIACON), Computing, <mark>Intelligence</mark>, and Application (CIACON), 2025 International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250718,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Measurement; Deep learning; Adaptation models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Semantics; Education; Question generation; Hybrid learning; Context modeling; Automatic Question Generation; LLaMA 3.1; Language Models for Education; Deep Learning for Digital Learning; Contextual Question Generation",Leveraging Generative AI for Enhanced Question Generation in Reading Comprehension,
"As demand grows for event recommendation systems capable of accommodating users with diverse backgrounds and preferences, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention. LLMs offer the ability to flexibly integrate multiple conditions, enabling highly personalized recommendations. However, this flexibility often results in longer prompts, which can degrade response accuracy. Additionally, optimal prompt structures may vary across LLM versions, leading to inconsistent performance.To address these issues, we propose a dynamic prompt optimization method that segments prompts based on LLM evaluations. We conducted experiments using ChatGPT-4o and evaluated the effectiveness of prompt segmentation to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that prompt segmentation improves recommendation accuracy but that its effectiveness saturates beyond a certain threshold. These findings suggest that determining the optimal number of prompt segments maximizes output quality while preventing unnecessary segmentation.","Oomoto, Shiori; Enoki, Miki; Oguchi, Masato",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/COMPSAC65507.2025.00047,kkdkj4p75b,,,,"2025 IEEE 49th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC), Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC), 2025 IEEE 49th Annual, COMPSAC",,300,295,,True,20250708,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Optimization methods; Software; Recommender systems; Large Language Models; Event Recommendation; Prompt Optimization,Optimization of Prompt Segmentation for Improving Event Recommendation Accuracy Using Generative Artificial Intelligence,
"This paper describes an attempt to automate threat hunting, taking cyber threat intelligence messages as input and generating queries to search logs for attack evidence using a popular query language, Kibana, used in Security Operations Centers (SOC). Our prototype implementation, AIThreatTrack, uses GPT-4 to extract actionable threat intelligence from real-time messages like X and Slack. The core idea is to explain the extracted intelligence in terms of MITRE ATT&amp;CK TTPs using a knowledge graph containing ""is-a"" and ""part-of"" relationships (extracted using GPT-4) with the following benefits:(a) Significantly reduced hallucinations from 47% (GPT-4) to 1.5% using two orthogonal ways to cross-check answers. (b) Gaining analysts’ trust with explained results. (c) Using chain-of-knowledge prompting to significantly improve query generation accuracy. This approach supports expanding the scope of the knowledge graph to further improve query generation.

"The rapid growth of e-commerce in Indonesia, with Tokopedia as a leading platform, generated an abundance of online reviews containing both text and images, which offered valuable insights into customer experiences. These reviews provided essential feedback that helped businesses understand consumer sentiment, preferences, and expectations. Traditional sentiment analysis models like BERT, RoBERTa, and FNet, performed well with text data but struggled with visual information. This research introduced a hybrid approach that combined Transfer Learning for text analysis with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image analysis to enhance overall multimodal sentiment analysis accuracy. When visual content was unavailable, Stable Diffusion v2-base can generated synthetic images from text, which significantly improved the availability of visual data. Following the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) framework, which included selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and evaluation, this study found that BERT achieved the highest text-based accuracy at 90.97 % and RoBERTa at 90.33 %. In the image-based approach, CNN reached an accuracy of 54.25 %, while the hybrid CNN-BERT model led with $\mathbf{9 0. 6 0 \%}$, followed by CNN-RoBERTa at $\mathbf{8 9. 4 0 \%}$. These findings highlighted the potential of multimodal sentiment analysis in providing effective marketing strategies, informing product development, and enhanced customer satisfaction, ultimately offering a significant competitive advantage in the e-commerce sector.","Karaeng, Cristin Natalia; Kristiyanti, Dinar Ajeng",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICERA66156.2025.11087376,uvgz6nucrr,,,,"2025 4th International Conference on Electronics Representation and Algorithm (ICERA), Electronics Representation and Algorithm (ICERA), 2025 4th International Conference on",,6,01,,True,20250612,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Sentiment analysis; Visualization; Accuracy; Text analysis; Reviews; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Transfer learning; Product development; Convolutional neural networks; Electronic commerce; Convolutional Neural Network-BERT; E-Commerce Product Review; Multimodal Sentiment Analysis; Transfer Learning",Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Approach Combining Transfer Learning and Generative AI of E-Commerce Product Reviews,
"In this article, we introduce multiagent strategic query resolution and diagnostic tool (MASQRAD), a transformative framework for query resolution based on the actor-critic model, which utilizes multiple generative AI agents. MASQRAD is excellent at translating imprecise or ambiguous user inquiries into precise and actionable requests. This framework generates pertinent visualizations and responses to these focused queries, as well as thorough analyses and insightful interpretations for users. MASQRAD addresses the common shortcomings of existing solutions in domains that demand fast and precise data interpretation, such as their incapacity to successfully apply AI for generating actionable insights and their challenges with the inherent ambiguity of user queries. MASQRAD functions as a sophisticated multiagent system but “masquerades” to users as a single AI entity, which lowers errors and enhances data interaction. This approach makes use of three primary AI agents: Actor Generative AI, Critic Generative AI, and Expert Analysis Generative AI. Each is crucial for creating, enhancing, and evaluating data interactions. The Actor AI generates Python scripts to generate data visualizations from large datasets within operational constraints, and the Critic AI rigorously refines these scripts through multiagent debate. Finally, the Expert Analysis AI contextualizes the outcomes to aid in decision-making. With an accuracy rate of 87% when handling tasks related to natural language visualization, MASQRAD establishes new benchmarks for automated data interpretation and showcases a noteworthy advancement that has the potential to revolutionize AI-driven applications.","Ur Rahman, M.W.; Nevarez, R.; Mim, L.T.; Hariri, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TAI.2025.3544173,rhcukpystr,,,8,"IEEE Transactions on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>, <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"Generative AI offers innovative opportunities for the digital development of LEGO education and poses the dual challenges of technological ethics and the nature of education. This study explores the core application scenarios of generative AI in the development of LEGO digital learning resources, which significantly improves the efficiency and creative boundaries of educational resource development. Generative AI significantly improves the development efficiency and creative boundaries of digital learning resources by rapidly generating LEGO model prototypes and assisting interdisciplinary curriculum design. At the same time, it dynamically adjusts task difficulty and provides real-time feedback by analyzing student behavioral data, enabling truly personalized learning support. These applications lower the threshold of innovation, expand educational possibilities, and promote the construction of a sustainable education ecosystem by optimizing the reuse of resources. However, this convergence also poses key techno-ethical risks, including data bias, privacy concerns arising from excessive data collection from children, and homogenization of creativity due to AI “best solution” algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a two-track evaluation mechanism for “ethical education” that defines the boundaries of human-computer collaboration, and emphasizes the need for shared social responsibility to ensure positive empowerment in the generation of AI. Future research directions include deepening multi-sensory learning experiences that combine reality with reality, and further exploring synergistic development paths between technology and human-centered education.","Liang, Zhaoying; Zhang, Fangye; Zhou, Tiange",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICAIE64856.2025.11158547,mzbwoxjlyn,,,,"2025 5th International Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Education (ICAIE), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Education (ICAIE), 2025 5th International Conference on",,784,779,,True,20250514,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Ethics; Technological innovation; Data privacy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Ecosystems; Prototypes; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Data collection; Real-time systems; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Lego Education; Digital Learning Resources; Educational Ethics; Personal-ized Learning; Inter-disciplinary Integration; Creative Development,Generative AI in LEGO Education: Opportunities &amp; Ethical Challenges in Digital Learning Development,

"This study focuses on the value conflicts and practical challenges arising from the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education. Based on Weber's dual framework of instrumental rationality and value rationality, combined with Strauss's metaphor of the “second cave” the study systematically analyzes the profound impact of instrumental rationality on the essence of education. While generative AI offers significant advantages in enhancing teaching effectiveness, optimizing resource allocation, and achieving personalized learning, its overuse may lead to the prioritization of utilitarian educational goals and the mechanization of knowledge transmission. In response to this contradiction, the study proposes a “teacher-AI-student” triadic interaction model, emphasizing that the application of technology should adhere to the principles of assistive, transparent, and inclusive use. Innovatively, the study constructs a differentiated educational strategy based on the “learning ability-willingness matrix”, providing precise personalized support for different learners. In the process of digital transformation in education, it is crucial to fully leverage technological advantages while steadfastly adhering to the humanistic values, thereby achieving a dynamic balance between instrumental rationality and value rationality. The study has important theoretical value and practical significance in advancing educational innovation, deepening educational practice reforms, and building a sustainable technology-empowered education model.","Yang, Xiaoyu; Qiao, Xuefeng; Wen, Bingchun",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICAIE64856.2025.11158117,ozr6isbwyn,,,,"2025 5th International Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Education (ICAIE), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Education (ICAIE), 2025 5th International Conference on",,230,226,,True,20250514,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Technological innovation; Philosophical considerations; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Instruments; Digital transformation; Education; Buildings; Resource management; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Instrumental Rationality; Value Rationality; Technological Governance; Philosophy of Education,Beyond the Digital Cave: Reshaping Educational Values and Exploring Practical Pathways in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence,
"The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technology has accelerated the reform in the field of education and opened up a new development path for English writing teaching in middle schools. However, in the actual teaching process, there are still problems with the rigid application of artificial intelligence and the lack of data support for learning situation analysis. Therefore, exploring the deep integration model of generative artificial intelligence technology and English writing teaching in middle schools is particularly urgent. By the theory of process-genre approach and blended teaching model, we construct a teaching model of middle school English writing assisted by generative artificial intelligence from three dimensions: teaching resources, teaching process and teaching evaluation. This teaching model realizes the enrichment and personalization of teaching resources, integrates generative artificial intelligence into every step of the teaching process, and comprehensively improves the teaching efficiency and quality of English writing in middle school.","Qi, Zhiwei; Liu, Yuqing; Liu, Wenlin",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICAIE64856.2025.11158028,fn4qo4jctf,,,,"2025 5th International Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Education (ICAIE), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Education (ICAIE), 2025 5th International Conference on",,406,402,,True,20250514,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Solid modeling; Systematics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Reviews; Knowledge acquisition; Education; Knowledge based systems; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Optimization; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; English writing; teaching model; blended teaching,Research on Middle School English Writing Teaching Model Assisted by Generative Artificial Intelligence,
"Promoting student engagement in CSCL has been an important issue for educators. Previous studies have attempted to design retrieval-based conversational agents to assist students in completing collaborative tasks. However, few studies have explored how to integrate generative artificial intelligence with scaffolds to promote student engagement. Addressing the gap, this study developed a collaborative platform that integrates scaffolds with generative AI-based conversational agent. Additionally, a quasi-experiment involving 42 undergraduate students was conducted to examine the impact of this intervention on student engagement, including behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. The results demonstrated that while the intervention did not significantly improve overall student engagement, it led to a notable increase in cognitive engagement. These findings suggest that generative AI-based agents, when combined with scaffolds, have the potential to target and enhance specific dimensions of engagement in CSCL environments.","Liu, Qian; Yang, Xianmin; Li, Xin",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICAIE64856.2025.11158054,6sef7s6ran,,,,"2025 5th International Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Education (ICAIE), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Education (ICAIE), 2025 5th International Conference on",,116,113,,True,20250514,IEEE,Computing and Processing; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Federated learning; Education; Collaboration; Intelligent agents; Problem-solving; student engagement; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; scaffolds,Promoting Student Engagement in CSCL Through Scaffolds and Generative AI-Based Conversational Agent,
"Programming education has gained prominence in the intelligent era, yet students frequently encounter coding errors and struggle with algorithm comprehension, which diminishes their learning engagement.

"To analyze the current application status, technical characteristics, and challenges of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) in perinatal health care for advanced maternal age pregnant women and explore targeted optimization strategies. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang Data from January 2020 to April 2025. Studies were included if they focused on Generative AI applications in perinatal care for women aged ≥ 35 years; 78 eligible studies (42 Chinese, 36 international) were finally included, covering technical applications, clinical validation, and ethical governance. We summarized the applications of Generative AI in risk prediction, personalized management, and remote monitoring, and analyzed issues related to data governance, technical limitations, resource allocation, and ethical supervision. Results: Generative AI improves healthcare efficiency by integrating multiple data sources for model construction, planning dynamic interventions, and facilitating remote monitoring. Specifically, GANs-based models achieve an AUC of 0.80– 0.85 in predicting Group B Streptococcus infection, while Transformer models enhance the accuracy of prenatal depression screening by 15– 20% compared to traditional methods. However, it faces challenges including data privacy risks (eg, 32% of maternal health institutions lack encrypted data storage), the ""black box"" nature of models (42% of clinicians report low trust in AI decision-making), urban-rural technological gaps (only 18% of county-level hospitals use AI perinatal tools), and ambiguous liability definitions. Conclusion: Generative AI demonstrates significant application potential in perinatal care for advanced maternal age pregnant women. Promoting its implementation through technological innovation (eg, explainable AI), interpretability optimization, resource deployment (eg, lightweight mobile tools), and ethical supervision is crucial to improving maternal and infant health outcomes in China and globally. Plain Language Summary: As more women delay pregnancy until age 35 or older (advanced maternal age), they face higher risks of complications like gestational diabetes and preterm birth—risks traditional healthcare struggles to address with personalized, round-the-clock care. This review explores how Generative AI (technology that analyzes data to generate new insights) could transform care for this group. We searched 4 international and Chinese databases (2020– 2025) and analyzed 78 studies. We found Generative AI can: Predict risks early: Use medical records and real-time data to spot issues like infections or depression before they worsen (eg, AI models correctly identify 80% of Group B Streptococcus cases by 35 weeks of gestation); Create tailored plans: Design personalized nutrition, exercise, and mental health strategies based on each woman's needs (eg, AI nutritional interventions reduce gestational diabetes-related macrosomia by 22%); Monitor remotely: Use wearable devices to track vital signs and alert doctors to emergencies—especially helpful in rural areas where healthcare resources are limited. However, challenges remain: Patient data is not always secure, doctors often do not understand how AI makes decisions, rural hospitals rarely have access to AI tools, and no clear rules exist for who is responsible if AI makes a mistake. Our findings mean that with better data protection, transparent AI algorithms, and fair access to technology, Generative AI could make high-quality perinatal care more accessible—helping advanced maternal age women have healthier pregnancies and babies, both in China and around the world.","Tang, Shasha; Zhao, Shihong",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.2147/IJWH.S542758,l6ey76kpsr,,,,International Journal of Women's Health,,3085,3077,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=l6ey76kpsr&recordId=l6ey76kpsr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250901,Dove Medical Press Ltd,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Maternal age; Prognostic models; Telemedicine; Pregnant women; Data integrity; China; Perinatal care,Research Progress and Clinical Implications of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Perinatal Health Care for Advanced Maternal Age Pregnant Women.,17
"This study presents a carefully conducted quantitative analysis to demonstrate how generative AI and big data analytics can significantly enhance risk assessment of credit and charge card usage, a key challenge for the banking sector. The underlying data analytics methods can be applied to multiple related data mining challenges, including high-performing fraud detection and pattern analyses to support strategic operational management decision-making through a deep understanding of consumer behavior. The research complements these data and machine learning studies by developing the use of generative AI to model hidden attributes, including consumer spending behavior. In this new paper, we use big data analytics to assess consumer behavior and understand how spending patterns can be used to predict over-limit card usage fraudulently made by active card users to ensure intense model experimentation leading to increased fraud detection success. The recently built algorithms can further be exploited to digitally recreate the corresponding spending behavior and offer a novel solution to credit and charge card over-limit fraud detection based on information revealed in the form of generated data and hidden driver variable output rather than model parameters. The methodological approach adopted for this study, the results presented and analyzed, and the established conclusions where credit card over-limit is detected with a high level of precision and recall during the legacy, validation, and prediction phases appear to be both novel and theoretically sound. As a result, one could argue that our published document makes a significant scientific contribution and should have a wide audience. The paper's content should be of interest to both academics and early career researchers who work in data mining and big data, including those working in the specific subjects of credit and charge cards; commercial experts will benefit from the economic understanding of this best practice. The development of artificial intelligence and machine learning, often complemented by predictive analytics, represents some of the most resourceful data mining and big data technologies.

"AbstractHealth professions educators face a challenge of leveraging generative AI to enhance learning while preventing passive engagement that undermines the critical thinking essential for patient safety. Faculty express concerns about AI fostering superficial understanding, yet many institutions lack appropriate pedagogical solutions. This challenge is compounded by variations in faculty AI expertise across institutions, hindering the intentional integration of AI into educational practices, ultimately leaving students to use these tools without proper guidance. To address the challenge, we developed a prompt-powered worksheet that empowers faculty to create learning tools while preserving critical thinking skills when students use AI for learning. The worksheet guides faculty through sequential steps using pre-designed prompts with their chosen chatbot as a brainstorming partner, eliminating the need for complex AI prompting skills while maintaining human expertise in pedagogical design. Testing of the prompt-powered worksheet at an international workshop demonstrated the universal accessibility of the strategy regardless of prior AI experience.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and edge intelligence (EI) are driving the evolution of traditional vehicular networks toward the intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IIoV) by providing foundational and personalized knowledge. However, their inherently contradictory characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV.

"The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) offers unprecedented opportunities for technological innovation and societal advancement, while also posing significant risks and challenges. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) – exemplified by models such as ChatGPT – relies heavily on deep learning architectures, resulting in increased technical complexity and reduced interpretability. As a result, Generative AI exacerbates a variety of risks common to traditional AI systems, including data security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, copyright infringements, and algorithmic biases. This study critically assesses the adequacy of current regulatory frameworks in addressing these risks. The findings suggest that traditional legal instruments are insufficient for managing the unique challenges posed by Generative AI, increasing the likelihood of regulatory failure.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education, offering students new opportunities for learning and research. However, concerns about the potential for AI to produce inaccurate or misleading information—commonly referred to as ""hallucinations""—have raised questions about the impact of these tools on student learning and academic integrity. This research paper examines how students' awareness of AI tools, the types of academic tasks they are assigned, faculty support, and institutional policies influence their perceptions and attitudes toward the use of generative AI for academic purposes. The study utilized a descriptive-correlational design, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which provides insights into how users accept and effectively utilize technology. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed as a robust statistical technique to analyze the impact of various factors on college students' perceptions and attitudes regarding the use of generative AI for academic work. The study's constructs were assessed for reliability and validity using Cronbach's Alpha, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), and the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio. The findings indicate that the complexity and intensity of academic tasks, students' engagement with generative AI platforms, and the support they receive from educational stakeholders significantly influence their attitudes toward using these platforms for academic assignments. Conversely, students' perceptions of generative AI are heavily shaped by the support systems available to them and their understanding of the potential risks associated with using such technologies for their assignments and projects. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion about the ethical and practical implications of AI in education, providing valuable insights into best practices for integrating AI technologies to enhance learning while upholding academic integrity.","Torres, Ramachandra C.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/IC4e65071.2025.11075444,54vzfdivf5,,,,"2025 16th International Conference on E-Education, E-Business, E-Management and E-Learning (IC4e), E-Education, E-Business, E-Management and E-Learning (IC4e), 2025 16th International Conference on",,449,445,,True,20250426,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Electronic learning; Technology acceptance model; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Numerical analysis; Education; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Mathematical models; Stakeholders; Reliability; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; <mark>AI</mark> Hallucination; Academic Tasks; Student Awareness; Support System; <mark>AI</mark> Usage; Structural Equation Modelling",AI Hallucination in the Context of Education: Exploring College Students’ Use of Generative AI for Academic Tasks,
"With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, the detection and governance of fake news has become a hot topic of concern in academia and society. The wide dissemination of fake news not only disrupts the public's information perception but also triggers social phenomena such as information epidemics, posing significant challenges to social stability, political environment and public health. Especially driven by social media, the speed and breadth of information dissemination have greatly intensified the spread of fake news. The research findings indicate that Generative AI mainly focuses on the optimization of natural language processing and deep learning technologies, providing new technical support for the detection of fake news. Meanwhile, the role of social media platforms and information dissemination pathways have become the focus of scholars' attention. However, issues such as the dissemination of cross-platform fake news, the practical application of generative AI, and the accuracy and robustness of algorithms remain the main challenges in current research. In this regard, this article suggests that future research should further optimize large-scale language models, promote innovation in multimodal fake news detection technology, and strengthen research on cross platform fake news dissemination mechanisms, in order to provide more accurate and effective technical support for fake news governance and alleviate its negative impact on society.","Wang, Aiyu; Gu, Tianyu",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/AINIT65432.2025.11035708,zjcmknet3f,,,,"2025 IEEE 6th International Seminar on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>, Networking and Information Technology (AINIT), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>, Networking and Information Technology (AINIT), 2025 IEEE 6th International Seminar on",,1607,1603,,True,20250411,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Deep learning; Seminars; Technological innovation; Accuracy; Systematics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Social networking (online); Natural language processing; Stability analysis; Fake news; Generate <mark>AI</mark>; LLM; Disinformation",Exploring the Convergence of Generative AI and Fake News Detection: Technological Advancements and Challenges,

"This research examines differences in consumer responses to large language model AI chatbots versus search engines when reviewing and evaluating product information in the information search stage of the purchase decision process. Building on the mere exposure effect, the consumer–brand relationships literature, and consumer decision-making research, this research investigates consumer search preferences and self-disclosure willingness along with a psychological mechanism. We conducted an experiment comparing two types of product search tools and tested a moderated mediation using Process Model 15. The findings suggest that consumers prefer search engines over AI chatbots and are more willing to self-disclose their personal information to search engines (vs. AI chatbots) due to perceived familiarity. However, we find that the quality of consumers' relationship with the source of information moderates this effect. Further, we show that consumers evaluate AI chatbot-based results as less biased than traditional search engine results. Contrary to previous research that has mainly focused on AI chatbots' functional aspects in consumer adoption, the current research emphasizes the psychological and relational aspects of product search perception and preference. In this way, we offer novel insights into a purchase decision-making process and consumer engagement as consumers adopt AI chatbot technology for product search.","Kim, Soyoung; Priluck, Randi",Business Source Ultimate,,10.3390/jtaer20020093,62mx5iucrv,,,2,Journal of Theoretical &amp; Applied Electronic Commerce Research,,,93,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=62mx5iucrv&recordId=62mx5iucrv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,MDPI,Consumer goods; Consumer behavior; Consumer preferences; All Other Consumer Goods Rental; Language models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Chatbots,Consumer Responses to Generative AI Chatbots Versus Search Engines for Product Evaluation.,20

"Contact centers now rely on intelligent chatbots and virtual assistants that detect and respond to customer emotions in real time. The paper presents a novel method for detecting emotions in customer care chat by utilizing a hybrid model that combines the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) networks. This combination of features enhanced AI capabilities. This method overcomes the limitations of current emotion recognition techniques by integrating BERTs contextual understanding with Bi-LSTMs sequential modeling power. It allows for more accurate and nuanced understanding of customer emotions. We process incoming customer messages in real time-our hybrid BERT + Bi-LSTM classifier detects emotions and a generative AI module drafts agent responses with end-to-end latency below 200 ms. Analyzing customer-agent interactions to classify emotions such as frustration, anger, sadness, and satisfaction. By incorporating Generative AI, the model not only detects emotions but also generates context-aware responses to de-escalate tense situations, providing agents with actionable insights and support. The proposed solution is validated using real-world contact center data, demonstrating superior performance in emotion recognition and aggression detection compared to existing methods. This advancement paves the way for improved customer experiences, reduced agent burnout, and enhanced operational efficiency in high-stress contact center environments. The integration of BERT-Bi-LSTM with Generative AI represents a significant step forward in creating empathetic, intelligent, and proactive customer care systems.","G, Sandra Karunya.; Sathish, A.",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1038/s41598-025-15501-y,e6vkkp4qov,,,1,Scientific Reports,,22,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=e6vkkp4qov&recordId=e6vkkp4qov&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251001,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Customer services; Chatbots; Customer experience; Sentiment analysis; Language models; Real-time computing; Long short-term memory,Intelligent emotion sensing using BERT BiLSTM and generative AI for proactive customer care.,15

"Background: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be used to support healthcare professionals. An in-depth understanding of how healthcare professionals adopt and use GAI in practice is lacking. We aimed to identify the intention to use GAI in nursing practice, its application areas, and the key factors associated with this intention. Methods: This cross-sectional study comprised an online survey with 46 items to assess nurses' intention to use GAI. Data were collected between March 17 and 28, 2025. The participants were 176 nurses working at a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea. Descriptive statistics, Mann–Whitney U tests, Kruskal–Wallis H tests, correlation analyses, multiple regression analyses, and an exploratory subgroup analysis were performed. Results: Overall, 61.4% of nurses reported having no experience with GAI, whereas 38.6% had used it, primarily in educational material development (50.0%) and data analysis (26.5%). Voluntariness (coefficient = 0.358, p &lt;.001), performance expectancy (coefficient = 0.344, p &lt;.001), and GAI literacy (coefficient = 0.192, p =.010) were key factors associated with usage intention; experience with GAI, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived risk were not significantly associated with the intention to use GAI. The subgroup analysis revealed that the influence of key factors was moderated by prior user experience. Conclusions: This study revealed that voluntariness, performance expectancy, and GAI literacy are key drivers of nurses' intention to use GAI. Notably, their importance differs according to user experience, highlighting the need for tailored strategies to get nurses to use GAI. In the future, the sustained value of GAI in nursing practice should be assessed.","Choe, Jeongin; Woo, Kyungmi",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1186/s12912-025-03985-y,5ztalnqkxz,,,1,BMC Nursing,,12,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=5ztalnqkxz&recordId=5ztalnqkxz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251024,BioMed Central,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Work; Cross-sectional method; Statistical power analysis; Statistical correlation; Scale analysis (Psychology); Data analysis; Cronbach's alpha; Hospital nursing staff; Statistical sampling; Kruskal-Wallis Test; Multiple regression analysis; Sex distribution; Tertiary care; Mann Whitney U Test; Descriptive statistics; Age distribution; Work experience (Employment); Intention; Nursing practice; Computer literacy; Nurses' attitudes; Research; Statistics; Sociodemographic factors; Data analysis software; Job performance; Experiential learning; Nonparametric statistics; Educational attainment; South Korea; Marketing Research and Public Opinion Polling; Specialty (except Psychiatric and Substance Abuse) Hospitals,Factors associated with intention to use generative artificial intelligence in nursing practice: a cross-sectional study.,24
"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered significant attention for its remarkable capabilities and is now widely used in many creative domains, sparking scientific interest in its creative capacities. While previous studies have assessed GenAI on creativity tasks, there is no evidence comparing the latest GenAI models to the same sample of humans on both divergent and convergent thinking assessments. In this study, we compared the creative ability of human participants (n = 46) against three state-of-the-art GenAI chatbots—ChatGPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini 2.0—using the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and the Remote Associates Test (RAT). For divergent thinking, we compared the median and maximum originality scores on the AUT, representing the level of originality of the 'average' and 'best' idea. We then compared performance on 57 RAT items as a measure of convergent thinking. All GenAI models outperformed human participants in both tasks: the 'average' and 'best' GenAI ideas were significantly more original than human-generated ideas. All GenAI models demonstrated superior RAT performance vs. humans. Among GenAI models, ChatGPT-4o consistently demonstrated the best scores on both tasks. These findings illustrate the immense creative potential of GenAI, but call into question the appropriateness of current creativity assessment methods in the study of GenAI creativity.","Arora, Vikram; Thabane, Alex; Parpia, Sameer; Calic, Goran; Bhandari, Mohit",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1038/s41598-025-21398-4,zhjqisewfv,,,1,Scientific Reports,,12,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=zhjqisewfv&recordId=zhjqisewfv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251022,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Divergent thinking; ChatGPT; Critical thinking; Creative ability; Gemini (Chatbot),Generative artificial intelligence models outperform students on divergent and convergent thinking assessments.,15
"Researchers have been using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to support writing manuscripts for several years now. However, as GenAI evolves and scientists are using it more frequently, the case for mandatory disclosure of GenAI for writing assistance continues to diverge from the initial justifications for disclosure, namely (1) preventing researchers from taking credit for work done by machines; (2) enabling other researchers to critically evaluate a manuscript and its specific claims; and (3) helping editors determine if a submission satisfies their editorial policies. Our initial position (communicated through previous publications) regarding GenAI use for writing assistance was in favor of mandatory disclosure. Nevertheless, as we show in this paper, we have changed our position and now support instituting a voluntary disclosure policy because currently (1) the credit due to machines for assisting researchers is moving below the threshold of requiring recognition; (2) it is impractical (if not impossible) to accurately specify what parts of the text are human-/GenAI-generated; and (3) disclosures could increase biases against non-native speakers of the English language and compromise the integrity of the peer review system. Consequently, we argue, it should be up to the authors of manuscripts to disclose their use of GenAI for writing assistance. For example, in disciplines where writing is the hallmark of originality, or when authors believe disclosure is beneficial, a voluntary checkbox in manuscript submission systems, visible only after publication (rather than a free-text note in the manuscripts) would be preferable.","Hosseini, Mohammad; Gordijn, Bert; Kaebnick, Gregory E.; Holmes, Kristi",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1177/17470161251345499,3r53byuhhf,,,4,Research Ethics,,735,728,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=3r53byuhhf&recordId=3r53byuhhf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251001,Sage Publications Inc.,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Disclosure; Cognitive bias; Manuscripts; Scholarly peer review; Research ethics; Attribution of authorship; Manuscript preparation (Authorship),Disclosing generative AI use for writing assistance should be voluntary.,21

Drawing on a qualitative framework, the research engaged students in a task-based learning environment that integrated tools such as ChatGPT and image generators into authentic teaching design tasks. Data were collected through reflective journals, interviews, and teaching artifacts. Thematic analysis revealed three core trajectories of professional growth: (1) a shift from uncertainty to confidence in using AI tools; (2) the situated development of TPACK through iterative design and reflection; and (3) the emergence of critical awareness regarding AI ethics, accuracy, and bias. Students not only explored how AI could support their instructional creativity, but also expressed concerns about content reliability and the limitations of automated outputs. Their reflections illustrated an evolving understanding of AI not just as a tool, but as a coparticipant in instructional reasoning.

"The development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has started a conversation on its possible uses and inherent difficulties in the field of education. It becomes essential to understand the perceptions of pre-service teachers about the integration of this technology into teaching practices as AI models including ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini acquire popularity. This investigation sought to create a valid and trustworthy instrument for evaluating pre-service science teachers' opinions on the implementation of generative AI in educational settings related to science. This work was undertaken within the faculty of education at Kazan Federal University. The total number of participants is 401 undergraduate students. The process of scale development encompassed expert evaluation for content validity, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and assessments of reliability. The resultant scale consisted of four dimensions: optimism and utility of AI in science education, readiness and openness to AI integration, AI's role in inclusivity and engagement, and concerns and skepticism about AI in science education. The scale demonstrated robust psychometric properties, evidenced by elevated reliability coefficients. Cluster analysis unveiled distinct profiles of pre-service teachers based on their responses, encompassing a spectrum from enthusiastic participants to skeptical disengaged individuals. This study provides a comprehensive instrument for evaluating pre-service teachers' perceptions, thereby informing teacher education programs and professional development initiatives regarding the responsible integration of AI. Recommendations entail the validation of the scale across varied contexts, the exploration of longitudinal changes, and the investigation of subject-specific applications of generative AI in science education.",Izida I.

"The rapid and widespread integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into educational settings marks a significant paradigm shift, presenting a dual narrative of transformative potential and profound challenges. This paper critically examines the impact of generative AI on education through three interconnected thematic lenses. First, it analyzes the disruptive effects on pedagogical practices and student development, highlighting the tension between the promise of hyper-personalized learning and the risks of intellectual homogenization and student de-skilling. Second, the paper conceptualizes generative AI as a potent instrument of ""soft power."" It argues that AI systems, developed predominantly in the Global North, are embedded with specific cultural and ideological values that can subtly reshape global educational norms, posing a threat to local educational traditions and intellectual sovereignty. Third, the paper employs the ""AI as the new nukes"" metaphor not as a literal comparison but as a critical framework to underscore the urgency for proactive governance and to analyze the systemic, dual-use nature of the technology. By exploring these themes, the paper contends that the primary challenge is not the technology itself, but the preservation of human agency in an increasingly automated world. It concludes by advocating for a form of educational sovereignty, calling for the adoption of robust, human-centric frameworks that prioritize augmentation over automation and critical AI literacy over simple policy enforcement. This requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders--educators, policymakers, students, and developers--to ensure that AI serves as a tool to enhance human potential rather than diminish it, thereby safeguarding the core humanistic values of education.",Aras Bozkurt; Ramesh C.

This paper examines the use of ChatGPT as an educational tool to teach writing and revision in a first-semester writing course in Fall 2023 at a regional university. The course used ChatGPT as a classroom model to show students how to ethically use generative AI as part of their writing and revision process.

"Generative AI has become a quotidian discussion topic in many writing departments, and the conversations often focus on the negative aspects or the disruptions it has caused. A growing number of teachers and scholars, though, have embraced the new technology and welcomed it into their classrooms. In the Spring 2024 semester, students in my first-year composition (FYC) classes completed an assignment that asked them to use generative AI to create an essay that they then re-worked through a combination of changing language/phrasing, changing content, and adding/removing content. This chapter argues that students are still doing rich and sophisticated rhetorical work like they would when beginning a piece from scratch. Grounded in Composition theory and scholarship, and featuring students' reflective thoughts on the assignment, this chapter makes the case that students understand and value their own voices in writing. Further, this study challenges the common belief that students want to take the easy way out and use generative AI uncritically. Rather, students seem to be comfortable with a new type of co-agency in which they use generative AI as a tool to assist them, not one that takes over.",Guy J.

"This study aims to explore the implications of using AI-generative tools (tools for generative AI (GAI)) in teaching and learning practices in higher education settings. This exploratory study employs a mixed-methods approach. Data was collected through focus-group discussions, participants' reflections and questionnaires. The participants of this study were 65 undergraduate students who enrolled in a university. The GAI tools were integrated into the course assignments. This study found that most students chose to use GAI tools alongside traditional tools to perform their assignments and exhibited a positive attitude towards using GAI tools to accomplish their tasks. The most significant impacts of integrating these emerging-technology tools in the course included a reduction in the time needed to complete the assignments and efficiency and creativity in producing different types of interactive digital content. However, notable challenges were identified regarding the quality and authenticity of the new content. In addition, the findings revealed significant differences between the pre- and post-tests mean scores using GAI tools in students' learning, further reinforcing the effectiveness of these tools.

"In recent years, the number of studies on artificial intelligence or AI has increased tremendously, and their place in daily life is beginning to be felt more and more each day. Current rise of generative AI tools has brought forth dangers regarding its potential misuse, leading to impacts on the environment. College students were surveyed using an infographic and a 5-point Likert scale to assess their awareness regarding these environmental implications. The students exhibited a lack of awareness on most of the implications, only recognizing generative AI's impact on the environment to a certain extent. In particular, the awareness of students on the environmental implications of generative AI such as its carbon footprint resulted in an unclear consensus. Additionally, students only showed an understanding of the electricity that generative AI demands and not also the fresh water and rare metals it consumes. The data suggests that this lack of awareness may stem from insufficient knowledge regarding generative AI. To address these concerns, further promotion in raising awareness was recommended, and an infographic was proposed.",Charles Aaron B. Dungo; Zak Laurence E. Beltran; Bryan C. Declaro; Jan Jacek C.

"Since its emergence, generative AI has significantly impacted various fields, including English language education. Numerous academic studies have investigated its capabilities in grammar correction, writing evaluation, and dynamics of user interaction. However, there have been insufficient investigations into whether texts generated by such AI align appropriately with CEFR proficiency levels. This study addresses this gap by exploring the applicability of generative AI to CEFR standards. Multiple texts were generated using ChatGPT-4o with specified CEFR levels and analyzed using a vocabulary level analyzer (CVLA) to evaluate text features. The findings revealed discrepancies between AI-generated texts and textbook standards, significant divergences between levels below B1 and above B2, and a noticeable topic bias.

"The examination of the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on higher education, especially from the viewpoint of students, is gaining significance. Although prior research has underscored GenAI's potential advantages in higher education, there exists a discernible research gap concerning the determinants that affect its adoption. In the present study, we aim to enhance our comprehension of the factors influencing the willingness of higher education students to adopt GenAI tools. To achieve this, we have developed an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model incorporating specific GenAI constructs. Our research methodology entailed the selection of a diverse sample of 374 students through random sampling. We then analyzed their data using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to gain insights into the complex relationships between various variables. The study found that students are more likely to use GenAI tools when they view them as supplemental resource and effort expectancy. It also revealed that perceived costs negatively impact adoption intentions, highlighting that financial factors are a significant barrier. Interestingly, Factors like information accuracy and hedonic motivation did not significantly affect students' adoption intentions. This study offers key insights for eLearning practitioners on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) tools into educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of resource perception and effort expectancy, demonstrating GenAI's potential to personalize learning experiences. eLearning platforms can utilize GenAI to enhance active learning through engaging methods and streamline course development. Addressing cost barriers is crucial for equitable access and inclusivity. A gradual approach to integration aligned with learning objectives is recommended, along with fostering critical engagement with GenAI tools to enhance digital literacy. Lastly, the study is constrained by its specific context, potential biases in self-reported data, a narrow focus on factors influencing students' intent to use GenAI tools and a cross-sectional design. Future research should encompass a broader range of factors, employ objective measures, and integrate observational data. Longitudinal studies or experimental designs could offer more comprehensive insights into how students' perceptions and intentions develop, thus promoting a more inclusive educational environment for all students.",Hanadi Aldreabi; Nisreen Kareem Salama Dahdoul; Mohammad Alhur; Nidal Alzboun; Najeh Rajeh Alsalhi,ERIC,,,xruysfru3j,,,1,Electronic Journal of e-Learning,,33,15,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=xruysfru3j&recordId=aitwxbqwtv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250101,,Student Behavior; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Natural Language Processing; Technology Uses in Education; College Students; Student Attitudes; Costs; Intention; Student Motivation; Expectation; Accuracy; Technology Integration; Educational Resources; Foreign Countries; Public Colleges; Jordan,Determinants of Student Adoption of Generative AI in Higher Education,23
"This convergent mixed methods research study investigated how a small, non-representative sample of Educational Doctorate (EdD) faculty perceive and use generative AI and how they have leveraged the technology to support EdD students. A cross-sectional survey was used to gather data from 27 EdD faculty members to assess their generative AI perceptions and use as of April 2024. Findings revealed widespread generative AI use among participants, with 89% utilizing the technology for a variety of tasks related to supporting EdD students, including brainstorming, lesson planning, building students' generative AI knowledge, and supporting dissertation research and writing. Generative AI use did not differ significantly based on demographic or background factors, but perceptions varied between users and nonusers, with users holding much more favorable attitudes about the technology. Both groups perceived it to pose a relatively low threat to their career, but nonusers perceived an even lower threat.

"Generative AI has recently gained the ability to generate computer code. This development is bound to affect how computer programming is taught in higher education. We used past programming assignments and solutions for textbook exercises in our introductory programming class to analyze how accurately one of the leading models, ChatGPT, generates solutions. We selected the ChatGPT-4 available through the Bing search engine for our testing. We used a one-tailed test to calculate success percentage of the textbook versus ChatGPT solutions to determine if there was a statistically significant difference. Neither the book nor ChatGPT provided perfect solutions. Analysis of the results showed that the generated code does not always meet the programming requirements, but also that instructions for generative AI coding and for traditional programming can be improved. We conclude with recommendations for incorporating generative AI in programming classes. [Note: The publication year (2024) shown in the citation on the PDF is incorrect.

"This paper proposes a framework for integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools into statistical training for Doctor of Education (EdD) students. The rigorous demands of doctoral education, coupled with the challenges of learning complex statistical software and coding language, often lead to anxiety and frustration among students, particularly those in part-time or online programs. This article explores how generative AI can serve as a scaffold for learning, potentially mitigating statistics anxiety and enhancing students' abilities to focus on core statistical concepts rather than software intricacies. The proposed framework, grounded in constructivist learning theory, outlines a process for faculty to facilitate dialogues using generative AI tools that support students in developing research questions, selecting appropriate statistical tests, checking assumptions, and conducting statistical analyses. By leveraging AI as a dialogic partner, students can engage in self-regulated learning and enhance critical thinking skills essential for practitioner-scholars. This approach has the potential to improve statistical training in EdD programs, producing more competent translators of research who can effectively apply and interpret statistical methods in their professional practice.

"In November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, a groundbreaking generative AI chatbot backed by large language models (LLMs). Since then, these models have seen various applications in education, from Socratic tutoring and writing assistance to teacher training and essay scoring. Despite their widespread use among high school and college students in the United States, there is limited research on students' understanding and perception of these technologies. This study aims to fill that gap by developing a novel framework for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) literacy, focusing on what undergraduate students know about generative AI and how they perceive the capabilities of AI chatbots. We designed a GenAI literacy survey to measure students' knowledge and perceptions, collecting data from 568 undergraduate students. The results show that about 60% of students use AI chatbots regularly for academic tasks, but they often overestimate the capabilities of these tools. However, increased knowledge about how generative AI works correlates with more accurate estimation of its capabilities in real-world tasks. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced GenAI and AI literacy to ensure students use these tools effectively and responsibly.

"Employee-generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) collaboration is becoming increasingly common in the workplace, profoundly impacting the instrumentality of relationships with colleagues. Drawing on social exchange theory, this study investigates how and when employee-GenAI collaboration influences employees' helping behavior and family involvement through the instrumentality of work relationships. The results from a three-wave longitudinal survey study in China indicated that employee-GenAI collaboration is negatively related to the perceived instrumentality of work relationships and helping behavior and positively related to family involvement. The perceived instrumentality of work relationships plays a mediating role in employee-GenAI collaboration, helping behaviors, and family involvement. Furthermore, the perceived credibility of GenAI not only moderates the relationship between employee-GenAI collaboration and the perceived instrumentality of work relationships, but also moderates the mediating role of the perceived instrumentality of work relationships.

"Research Summary: Strategic decisions are uncertain and often irreversible. Hence, predicting the value of alternatives is important for strategic decision making. We investigate the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in evaluating strategic alternatives using business models generated by AI (study 1) or submitted to a competition (study 2). Each study uses a sample of 60 business models and examines agreement in business model rankings made by large language models (LLMs) and those by human experts. We consider multiple LLMs, assumed LLM roles, and prompts. We find that generative AI often produces evaluations that are inconsistent and biased. However, when aggregating evaluations, AI rankings tend to resemble those of human experts. This study highlights the value of generative AI in strategic decision making by providing predictions. Managerial Summary: Managers are seeking to create value by integrating generative AI into their organizations. We show how managers can use generative AI to help evaluate strategic decisions. Generative AI's single evaluations are often inconsistent or biased. However, if managers aggregate many evaluations across LLMs, prompts, or roles, the results show that the resulting evaluations tend to resemble those of human experts. This approach allows managers to obtain insight on strategic decisions across a variety of domains with relatively low investments in time or resources, which can be combined with human inputs.","Doshi, Anil R.; Bell, J.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative tool in education, offering scalable individualized learning. However, there is a lack of theoretically informed and methodologically rigorous research on how GenAI can effectively augment learning. This manuscript addresses this gap by investigating the potential of a theory-informed GenAI chatbot, ChatTutor--designed for students--to facilitate generative sense-making by leveraging principles from generative learning theory. The study aimed to (1) extend theory by proposing how GenAI can support generative sense-making and (2) test its effects on conceptual knowledge, self-efficacy, and trust post-use and on conceptual knowledge, enjoyment, and behavioral intentions in a delayed follow-up. We conducted two between-subjects design experiments. Study 1 was a pre-registered experiment with 175 university students in an authentic cognitive psychology course, comparing ChatTutor with a generic GenAI system (ChatGPT) and a teaching-as-usual control. Study 2 replicated the design with 234 high school students, comparing ChatTutor to ChatGPT, and a re-study control. Results showed that ChatTutor significantly enhanced trust and enjoyment in both studies, and behavioral intentions in Study 1, compared to ChatGPT. It also improved conceptual knowledge over ChatGPT immediately in both studies and at follow-up in Study 2. ChatTutor outperformed the control condition in conceptual knowledge, although this difference was only significant in the follow-up of Study 1 and the immediate test of Study 2.

"The proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) tools has introduced new dynamics in user behaviour, environmental perception, and digital sustainability. This study, based on a primary questionnaire survey of 1,005 GenAI users aged 18 and above from India, investigates the frequency of GenAI usage and its relationship with climate change awareness, environmental concern, and willingness to adopt energy-efficient digital practices. Using regression-based models, the research reveals a pattern of indirect dependence: lower GenAI usage is related with a greater inclination toward environmentally responsible behaviours, such as transitioning from nonsustainable platforms and adopting energy-efficient digital services. In contrast, frequent GenAI users tend to perceive climate change as temporally distant and of lower immediate importance. The study also examines how the frequency and nature of social media usage influence users' attitudes toward sustainable technology choices. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, AI educators, digital strategists, and sustainability advocates aiming to foster environmentally conscious technology adoption in emerging economies like India.","CHITTINENI, Jyothi; MAHESWARI, Palanikumar; SAHILA, Chellamuthu; BALAKRISHNAN, Sathyamurthy",Business Source Ultimate,,10.57017/jorit.v4.2(8).03,mciyv25pgr,,,2,"Journal of Research, Innovation &amp; Technologies (JoRIT)",,172,159,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=mciyv25pgr&recordId=mciyv25pgr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,"Journal of Research, Innovation &amp; Technologies (JoRIT)",Attitudes toward technology; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Attitudes toward the environment; Geographical perception; Mass media influence,Generative Artificial Intelligence and Green Choices: Exploring Environmental Attitudes and Digital Behaviour in India.,4
"As generative AI technologies advance, understanding their capability to emulate human-like experiences in marketing communication becomes crucial. This research examines whether generative AI can create experiential narratives that resonate with humans in terms of embodied cognition, affect, and lexical diversity. An automated text analysis reveals that while reviews generated by ChatGPT 3.5 exhibit lower levels of embodied cognition and lexical diversity compared with reviews by human experts, they display more positive affect (Study 1a). However, human raters struggle to notice these differences, rating half of the selected reviews from AI higher in embodied cognition and usefulness (Study 1b). Instances of hallucination in AI-generated content were detected by human raters. For social media posts, the more sophisticated ChatGPT 4 model demonstrates superior perceived lexical diversity and leads to higher purchase intentions in unbranded content compared with human copywriters (Study 2). This research evaluates the performance of large language models in generating experiential marketing narratives. The comparative studies reveal the models' strengths in presenting positive emotions and influencing purchase intent while identifying limitations in embodied cognition and lexical diversity compared with human-authored content. The findings have implications for marketers and policy makers in understanding generative AI's potential and risks in marketing.","Wen, Yingting; Laporte, Sandra",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1177/07439156241297973,ux7vyolc75,,,3,Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing,,410,392,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=ux7vyolc75&recordId=ux7vyolc75&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,American Marketing Association,Marketing; Marketing Consulting Services; Language models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Hallucinations (<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Perception (Philosophy),Experiential Narratives in Marketing: A Comparison of Generative AI and Human Content.,44

"In the wave of technological innovation, generative artificial intelligence tools provide college students with personalized learning experience, promote autonomous learning and exploratory learning, and improve learning outcomes through intelligent tutoring and instant feedback. However, existing research shows that generative artificial intelligence tools still face multiple obstacles in practical application, such as differences in students' acceptance of new technologies, privacy protection challenges, and difficulties in integrating with the existing education system. This study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a technology acceptance model, and specifically introduces perceived risk as a moderating variable. Combining key factors such as college students' cognitive characteristics and technological environment, this study constructs a theoretical model that affects college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools.The study found that performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and convenience conditions have a significant positive impact on college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools; effort expectations have a positive impact on performance expectations; convenience conditions have a positive impact on effort expectations; effort expectations mediate the relationship between convenience conditions and willingness to use; and perceived risk negatively moderates the impact of convenience conditions on willingness to use. It is expected that through this empirical study, the key factors that affect college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools will be deeply explored, and valuable suggestions and references will be provided for guiding technology optimization and education integration practices, which will help develop generative artificial intelligence tools that better meet the needs of college students and promote innovation and improvement of online education models.","Li, Sigan; Zhang, Hongfeng; Du, Zhijun",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICETT66247.2025.11136950,hbadvpf4mb,,,,"2025 11th International Conference on Education and Training Technologies (ICETT), Education and Training Technologies (ICETT), 2025 11th International Conference on",,70,57,,True,20250523,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Training; Technological innovation; Privacy; Analytical models; Technology acceptance model; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Mathematical models; Usability; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> tools; College students; UTAUT model; PLS-SEM,Factors Influencing College Students’ Willingness to Use Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools——Based on the UTAUT Model,
"With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, especially the rise of large-scale language models and diffusion models, the field of semantic communication is facing new opportunities and challenges. Traditional semantic communication systems have some limitations in conveying semantic information in a dynamic environment, but generative artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to break through this bottleneck with its ability of context understanding and data generation. This paper proposes GenAI-SC, a generative semantic communication architecture that utilizes large-scale pre-training models for semantic information extraction and adopts a diffusion model as its core. The architecture extracts and compresses semantic information through large-scale models and utilizes diffusion models to achieve high-quality image recovery, which is especially suitable for complex communication environments. To verify the effectiveness of this architecture, this paper design two task modes, plain text diffusion image generation and text-image joint diffusion generation, to flexibly cope with different transmission tasks. The experimental results show that GenAI-SC performs well under different channel conditions and inference steps, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment, showing that GenAI-SC has good multitasking capability and communication robustness.

"The convergence of robotics, advanced communication networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of transforming industries through fully automated and intelligent operations. In this work, we introduce a novel co-working frame-work for robots that unifies goal-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) with a Generative AI (GenAI)-agent under a semantic-aware network. SemCom prioritizes the exchange of meaningful information among robots and the network, thereby reducing overhead and latency. Meanwhile, the GenAI-agent leverages generative AI models to interpret high-level task instructions, allocate resources, and adapt to dynamic changes in both network and robotic environments. This agent-driven paradigm ushers in a new level of autonomy and intelligence, enabling complex tasks of networked robots to be conducted with minimal human intervention. We validate our approach through a multi-robot anomaly detection use-case simulation, where robots detect, compress, and transmit relevant information for classification. Simulation results confirm that SemCom significantly reduces data traffic while preserving critical semantic details, and the GenAI-agent ensures task coordination and network adaptation. This synergy provides a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for modern industrial environments.","Li, Peizheng; Aijaz, Adnan",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS65812.2025.11152855,hdzuxcxb2b,,,,"IEEE INFOCOM 2025 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), IEEE INFOCOM 2025 - IEEE Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250519,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Industries; Service robots; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Robot kinematics; Simulation; Semantic communication; Dynamic scheduling; Real-time systems; Anomaly detection; Next generation networking; <mark>AI</mark>-native network; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> agent; net-worked robotics; semantic communications; variational autoen-coder; workflow",Task-Oriented Connectivity for Networked Robotics with Generative AI and Semantic Communications,
"With the rapid development of XR devices, holographic applications are expanding across various domains. However, it is a consensus that capturing and transmitting real-time holographic content still requires significant bandwidth. Even with the enhanced wireless capabilities of mobile systems, they still fall short of meeting the bandwidth and latency demands required for near-Gigabit per second interactive application scenarios. This paper proposes a network architecture that leverages MEC to address these challenges with the assistant of Generative AI. In this framework, the MEC server can leverage the power of the generative AI model to generate holographic objects with the input of user semantic commands, instead of requiring end-users to capture and transmit large raw holographic data. This approach significantly reduces uplink bandwidth requirements while enabling efficient real-time content generation. To validate this approach, we design an interactive and multisensory operational training scenario relying solely on semantic uplink transmissions from the end-users. The preliminary results based on the testbed implemented highlight the feasibility of deploying diverse holographic applications in wireless environments.","Qian, Peng; Redondo, Carlos Velez; Wang, Ning; Udora, Carl; Men, JingXuan; Tafazolli, Rahim",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS65812.2025.11152969,7osuejh7hv,,,,"IEEE INFOCOM 2025 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), IEEE INFOCOM 2025 - IEEE Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250519,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Wireless communication; Training; Multi-access edge computing; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Spectral efficiency; Semantics; Bandwidth; Network architecture; Real-time systems; Uplink; Holographic Application; extended reality (XR); mobile edge computing; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>",Enabling Generative AI based Multi-sensory XR Applications with Mobile Edge Computing,

In addition, realistic data is adversarially generated by training a generator and a discriminator. Then, through these models, the generated financial data or audit data can be compared with real data to identify potential risks. Finally, this study conducts experiments with sample data.

"Recent advances in generative AI have significantly expanded into the realms of art and music. This development has opened up a vast realm of possibilities, pushing the boundaries of human creativity into unexplored frontiers. However, as generative AI advances, it can replicate artistic styles and produce new artwork, posing significant concerns for the perceived rarity and value of artists' creations. In response to these challenges, it is becoming increasingly crucial to establish and enforce protective measures that safeguard artists' copyrighted work from unauthorized exploitation by generative AI models. In this paper, we introduce the first defensive mechanism, HARMONYCLOAK, to prevent the exploitative use of artwork, specifically in the context of instrumental music, by generative AI models. Particularly, HARMONYCLOAK employs imperceptible error-minimizing noise to make the model's generative loss approach zero for these perturbed music data, tricking the model into believing nothing can be learned so as to disrupt their attempts to replicate musical structures and styles. By using a set of intra-track and inter-track objective metrics and a subjective user study, extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art music generative AI models (i.e., MuseGAN, SymphonyNet, and MusicLM) validate the effectiveness and applicability of Harmonycloak 1. 1.

"This study assesses how generative artificial intelligence tools enhance computational thinking and problemsolving skills in the context of programming education. Generative AI (GenAI) has ushered in a new era in programming education, offering immediate, personalised support through tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. Although generative AI tools have shown promise in enhancing immediate problem-solving abilities, there is a lack of research on their long-term effects on students' computational thinking and professional programming skills development. This study conducted a scoped evaluation of previously published papers using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standard, and the data was analysed using a thematic approach. The findings from the study indicate that integrating GenAI can potentially enhance computational thinking and problem-solving for programming students. On the flipside, our study highlighted some significant ethical challenges associated with using GenAI in academia, particularly regarding issues of originality in student work. Contrary to expectations on how GenAI tools enhance learners' decomposition, abstraction, and algorithm design skills, most of the findings concentrated on students' completion of tasks. From a practical perspective, it is evident that GenAI has changed the learning landscape therefore, there is a need from a policy perspective to start thinking about the transformational roles of educators.

As UNESCO DirectorGeneral Audrey Azoulay aptly remarked, “Education will be profoundly transformed by AI.” This transformation impacts not only how knowledge is accessed but also how learning experiences are personalized, how curricula are developed, and how educators are trained. Despite the growing integration of AI tools into education, particularly generative AI, several critical questions remain: How effectively is generative AI being used to support and enhance learning? Are students merely passive recipients of AI-generated content, or are they active participants in more meaningful, personalized learning experiences? What specific generative AI tools are currently being implemented in classrooms, and how do both educators and students perceive their impact and integration? This paper presents the findings of a comprehensive survey conducted at Esprit School of Engineering (ESE) and Esprit School of Business (ESB). The goal is to capture the perspectives of students and teachers on the application and perceived impact of generative AI tools in educational settings. Using a Likert scale, the survey evaluates attitudes toward usability, effectiveness, and the potential of these tools to enhance both teaching and learning outcomes. Additionally, the study explores whether generative AI helps create a more engaging and interactive learning environment. The primary objective of this research is to explore how generative AI is perceived and utilized in classrooms, as well as the barriers and facilitators that affect its adoption. We begin by reviewing the current landscape of generative AI in education, focusing on its most prevalent applications. We then detail the survey methodology and analyze the results, offering insights into both opportunities and challenges posed by these AI tools. Finally, we conclude by discussing the broader implications of our findings and providing recommendations for future AI integration in education.","Ayari, Asma; Ouerfelli, Linda",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016392,swzo24zizf,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,6,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Surveys; Ethics; Technological innovation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Focusing; Robustness; Usability; Engineering education; Guidelines; education; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>,"Generative Ai in the Classroom: Balancing Innovation, Fear, and Necessity",
"As cybersecurity education continues to evolve, the need for curricula that effectively balance the capabilities of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools with the development of critical thinking and active learning skills has become increasingly urgent. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a curriculum for postgraduate cybersecurity education that focuses on developing transferable skills, particularly critical thinking and written communication. These skills are essential for cybersecurity professionals to excel in both their technical and communicationoriented responsibilities, meeting the growing demand of the cybersecurity industry in the age of AI. The proposed curriculum emphasizes the integration of constructivist learning principles and Bloom's taxonomy, two widely applied pedagogical models, to enhance learners' critical thinking and written communication skills. Designed for a penetration testing module, the curriculum follows a structured, step-by-step approach to build the necessary competences and empower aspiring cybersecurity professionals to meet the expectations of the cybersecurity industry. Through targeted activities, learners develop foundational knowledge while refining advanced written communication skills, equipping them to produce professional-level documentation, such as penetration testing reports. Generative AI is incorporated in the curriculum, providing opportunities for learners to experiment with AIgenerated content while fostering the cognitive skills needed to critically assess its accuracy, relevance, and alignment with professional standards. This study contributes to cybersecurity education by presenting a replicable curriculum model that equips learners with vital skills, preparing them to navigate the complexities of written communication responsibilities in cybersecurity roles and adapt to the evolving demands of the AI era.","Charalambous, Apostolos; Piki, Andriani; Kavrestad, Joakim; Stavrou, Eliana",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016486,7z3prkimfv,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Industries; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Navigation; Education; Taxonomy; Refining; Stakeholders; Mentoring; Standards; Penetration testing; Cybersecurity; penetration testing report; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; transferable skills; written communication skills; postgraduate education; curriculum design,Balancing Generative AI and Critical Thinking to Develop Written Communication Skills in Cybersecurity,
"This paper presents a novel method for enhancing active learning and outcomes in electronic engineering by combining Generative AI for Game-Based Learning (GBL), and transdisciplinary tutoring in Moodle LMS. The approach bridges Analog Electronics (3rd semester) and Digital Design with Microcontrollers (6th semester, embedded systems) engineering courses, fostering collaboration through game-based projects focused on real-world analog-digital integration. Generative AI supports this by generating adaptable game scenarios, problems, and feedback, tailored to each student's learning progress. By incorporating popular game mechanics like Monopoly (for technological evolution), Trivial Pursuit (for component knowledge), and Settlers of Catan (for system design), the approach engages students in key topics like diodetransistor circuits, microcontroller programming, and analogdigital system design. Games are supervised in Moodle using workshop and other activities for peer review, allowing students to submit solutions, review peers' work, and track progress through quizzes, forums, journals, and peer feedback. Analog Electronics students learn Arduino microcontroller applications for lab instrumentation, while Digital Design students explore analog components' roles in embedded systems, deepening understanding of analog-digital interactions. A pilot case study shows increased engagement, collaboration, and practical application of concepts, highlighting the potential for AI, GBL, and Moodle-based transdisciplinary tutoring to personalize learning and deepen comprehension in complex engineering topics. Future research will refine GBL AI-generated content and assess scalability across other STEM, career, and engineering fields.","Zamora Navarro, Francisco Javier",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016465,xwiqlzkaab,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,5,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Embedded systems; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Microcontrollers; Reviews; Conferences; Scalability; Collaboration; Games; Analog-digital conversion; STEM; Transdisciplinary Student-Centered Tutoring (TSCT); <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> (GenAI); Game Based Learning (GBL); PjBL; Moodle; Workshop; Quiz; Forum; Journal; Learning Object (LO); Analog Electronics; Embedded Systems; Arduino; CEXduino; LTSPICE; PROTEUS VSM; MPLABX IDE; Modern Electronics Game Board (MEGaBoard),"Enhancing Transdisciplinary Tutoring in Analog Electronics and Embedded Systems Using Generative AI, Game-Based Learning (GBL) and Moodle",
"The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has sparked significant interest in education, offering ways to support learning, personalize student experiences, and boost engagement. Generative AI holds the promise of transforming education with personalized learning, instant feedback, and assistance with complex problem-solving. However, its integration into classrooms requires careful management due to ethical concerns, misinformation risks, and potential misuse. While many articles explore the potential of generative AI in education, empirical studies on its real-world classroom use are limited. This paper presents an experience report on deploying a customized GPT-powered chatbot at Qatar University to support learning in two undergraduate courses: Data and Computer Communications Networks (technical) and Computer Ethics. Working across these diverse courses allows a thorough analysis of generative AI's strengths and weaknesses in different academic contexts, offering a comprehensive evaluation of its applicability and effectiveness. We used a mixed-methods approach with over 100 students, collecting quantitative and qualitative data via questionnaires to assess the chatbot's impact. Findings are analyzed with established theoretical frameworks to contextualize the pedagogical impact of generative AI, aligned with UNESCO guidelines for ethical integration. This paper details the chatbot's technical customization to meet course-specific needs, provides evidence-based insights into practical challenges and opportunities, and offers strategic recommendations for effective AI-assisted pedagogy. Directions for further research are also outlined to explore and refine the role of generative AI in classroom settings. By examining two distinct courses, this study demonstrates how generative AI can be adapted across academic disciplines for more nuanced applications in education.","Qadir, Junaid",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016479,eewwfpuucb,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Ethics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Terminology; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Chatbots; Reflection; Real-time systems; Problem-solving; Fake news; Guidelines; ChatGPT; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; pedagogy; education,Generative AI in Undergraduate Classrooms: Lessons from Implementing a Customized GPT Chatbot for Learning Enhancement,
"We are responding to calls for students to be trained in using generative AI (GAI). But training must take account of what students know; their prevailing attitudes; and their ethics with respect to using GAI. And knowing what our students know about GAI gives instructors an opportunity to co-construct meaningful teaching and learning moments. A class of 103 students, enrolled in the course Communication in the Engineering Sciences, in our BSc program in Electrical and Computer Engineering, was probed on their use of generative AI. The study draws on two datasets—student responses to a case study on unethical use of GAI and a questionnaire gathering qualitative data. Questionnaire responses reveal that generally students understand the basics of how GAI works. But this understanding is flawed, for example some students erroneously believe that GAI draws in real time from the Internet. Most respondents have used GAI in their studies, particularly to clarify concepts and summarize. We did not find widespread use of GAI for higher cognitive tasks. But this we suspect is linked to program sequencing: as students advance in their program more sophisticated uses of GAI are likely. This supports the need for longitudinal studies which track use in relation to program advancement. Like peers elsewhere, this class expressed concern about GAI's ability to propagate misinformation and bias; GAI-facilitated plagiarism; data privacy; and overreliance leading to impairment of learning. As it relates to whether GAI qualifies as an author, students demonstrated a fairly nuanced understanding of this complex issue. One student felt that this was a gray area, citing that even outside of GAI generated content, scholars build on each other's work to such an extent that the originality of any work can be questioned. In case study responses, all 103 students agreed that using GAI without permission is dishonest. Respondents noted that students, instructors, and university administration each have a responsibility to ensure that GAI is not misused. And like peers elsewhere, they welcome institutional policy and guidance on using GAI.","Mohammed, Crista; Rocke, Sean",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016545,a7sgfsz23r,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,8,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Ethics; Sequential analysis; Data privacy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Plagiarism; Real-time systems; Internet; Engineering education; Fake news; academic honesty; engineering education; ethics; freshmen; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>,"Electrical and Computer Engineering Freshmen and Generative AI: Awareness, Attitudes, and Ethics",
"The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has presented novel opportunities for innovation and practice in the field of education. This study utilizes a questionnaire survey approach to examine the factors influencing the application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in teachers' educational instruction, grounded in Diffusion of Innovation Theory. The research proposes hypotheses that teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction is influenced by seven factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, visibility, information channels, and teachers' personal innovativeness. Through correlation analysis, it is discovered that these influencing factors are significantly correlated with teachers' adoption and application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction. Regression analysis further reveals that compatibility and visibility have significant positive predictive effects on teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence. Based on the data results, this study proposes corresponding strategies to further enhance the diffusion of Generative Artificial Intelligence, aiming to improve the quality and efficiency of teachers' educational instruction, reduce their workload, and promote educational equity and high-quality balanced development.","Zhang, Jing; Liu, Lu; Tian, Yi; Yu, Xiaojie",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSTE64638.2025.11091919,q6fn3z7z6b,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), 2025 7th International Conference on",,483,479,,True,20250418,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Surveys; Computer science; Technological innovation; Correlation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Ions; Regression analysis; Complexity theory; Diffusion of Innovation Theory; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Digital instruction conducted by teachers; The adopt ion of technology in digital instruction; influencing factors",A Survey on the Application of Generative Artificial Intelligence by Primary and Secondary School Teachers from the Perspective of Innovation Diffusion,

"This study employs a quasi-experimental design to compare the effects of generative AI-supported teacher comments (experimental group) and traditional teacher comments (control group) on pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns in microteaching. Using lag sequence analysis, the study analyzes reflective behavior patterns based on 66 pre-service teachers' reflective texts on microteaching. The results indicate that generative AI-supported teacher comments significantly optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, particularly in terms of breadth and depth. The experimental group's reflective behaviors covered multiple dimensions, including teaching content (CW), teaching process and methods (PW), classroom atmosphere (AW), and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW), demonstrating comprehensiveness. Additionally, their reflective behaviors formed problem chains, such as ""teaching content → teaching process → classroom atmosphere"" (CW→PW→AW), reflecting stronger logic and depth. In contrast, the control group's reflective behaviors primarily focused on basic teaching skills (BW) and teaching process and methods (PW), with insufficient attention to classroom atmosphere (AW) and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW). Their reflections were more superficial and limited. Based on these findings, the study proposes recommendations to optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, aiming to enhance their microteaching reflection abilities and, consequently, their teaching competence development.","Meng, Li; Jiang, Ling; Lin, Yiran; Chen, Na; Hu, Wenshuang",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSTE64638.2025.11092194,65evt3vxzj,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), 2025 7th International Conference on",,200,196,,True,20250418,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computer science; Sequences; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Atmosphere; Process control; Reflection; Logic; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; teacher comments; pre-service teachers; reflective behavior patterns; microteaching",The Impact of Generative AI-Supported Teacher Comments on Pre-service Teachers' Reflective Behavior Patterns in Microteaching,

"Reproducing the results of a research paper is typically difficult and time consuming. Even when the source code is publicly available, the installation and configuration process can fail due to the slight differences in the versions of the software tools and libraries used by the original authors. Software images and containers are a solution to the dependency issues, since they provide the user with a complete environment with all the necessary components for running the software. But the steps for building such containers must be carefully engineered and described in detail. Generative AI tools may provide a valuable help to the human programmer during the development process. In this paper we present a method for building a software image of an open source code repository, which can be readily reproduced by any user. Generative AI is used for processing the textual information in the repository, and producing the building instructions. The AI agent is able to take into account any errors reported by the user in an iterative dialogue until a successful outcome is obtained.

The strategies we discuss fall into two broad categories. Containment strategies aim to reassert context in environments where it is currently threatened ‒ a reaction to the context-free expectations and norms established by the internet.

"Recent transition in mobile communication standards suggests massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to be an integral part of the foreseeable future. However, as antenna elements increase to hundreds in the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond, traditional signal processing methods become prone to significant hardware impairments compound from multiple chains, leading to a substantial performance degradation. This paper explores the effectiveness of generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in addressing these challenges within massive MIMO systems. For this purpose, the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), a special class of generative AI algorithms, is employed to enhance the accuracy of channel state information (CSI) estimation in a hardware-impaired transceiver setup. This problem is treated as an image-denoising task, where the noise is introduced by the hardware impairments and LS estimation error. Through simulations conducted across various antenna array sizes, the potential of generative AI to improve CSI estimation accuracy under hardware impairments is demon-strated. This highlights its capacity to address critical signal processing challenges in the next-generation wireless systems.","Banerjee, Bitan; Nimr, Ahmad; Fettweis, Gerhard",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/WCNC61545.2025.10978320,qmbaigy3cr,,,,"2025 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), 2025 IEEE",,6,1,,True,20250324,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Array signal processing; Massive MIMO; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Throughput; Hardware; Transceivers; Next generation networking; Antenna arrays; channel estimation; machine learning (ML); <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; conditional <mark>generative</mark> adversarial networks (CGAN)",Overcoming Hardware Limitations in Massive MIMO: A Generative AI Take,

"Ancient buildings, as an integral part of human cultural heritage, face tilting issues that not only affect their aesthetic appeal but may also lead to structural instability or even collapse, posing serious threats to building safety and human lives. Traditional monitoring methods rely on physical sensors and manual inspections, which suffer from limitations such as data scarcity, low prediction accuracy, and poor real-time performance. To address these challenges, this study proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based tilting prediction model for ancient buildings. By leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, diverse combinations of tilting and contributing factor data are generated, effectively resolving the issue of data scarcity. The model adopts a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, with inputs including contributing factors such as foundation settlement, vibration frequency, temperature, and humidity, and outputs including tilt angles and tilt rates, enabling accurate capture of complex nonlinear relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability, and its effectiveness is validated through a real-world monitoring system. This study provides scientific and technical support for early warning and preventive conservation of ancient building tilting, offering significant theoretical value and practical application.","Cao, Jiqing; Zhao, Xiaoyu",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ISCAIT64916.2025.11010640,z54bdbeh3v,,,,"2025 4th International Symposium on Computer Applications and Information Technology (ISCAIT), Computer Applications and Information Technology (ISCAIT), 2025 4th International Symposium on",,1101,1096,,True,20250321,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Vibrations; Accuracy; Temperature; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Buildings; Predictive models; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Data augmentation; Safety; Monitoring; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Ancient Building Tilting Prediction; <mark>Generative</mark> Adversarial Networks (GANs); Data Augmentation; Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)",Research on the Construction and Application of a Generative AI-Based Tilting Prediction Model for Ancient Buildings,
"Heart failure (HF) poses critical global health challenges, emphasizing the need for robust predictive models to support early diagnosis and enhance patient outcomes. Traditional machine learning (ML) models, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting Machines (xGBM), have shown effectiveness but face limitations in handling nonlinear relationships, addressing class imbalances, and generalizing across datasets. Deep learning (DL) models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), excel at identifying complex patterns but are hindered by computational requirements and limited interpretability, restricting clinical adoption. This research evaluates predictive models using nine datasets ranging from 299 to 400,000 records. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to address class imbalances, while a Stacking Generative AI (GenAI) model was developed. This hybrid model integrates Generative AI with RF, GBM, and CNNs, enhancing underrepresented subgroup representation through synthetic data generation. The Stacking Generative AI model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 98% accuracy and a Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) of 0.999 on a 1,025-record dataset. These results highlight the model's ability to handle complex data, enhance predictive accuracy, and improve clinical relevance.

Interoperability with VR and the metaverse modernizes education further. The issues in this are data collection, biases in algorithms, and the human interaction is reduced. That would require explainable algorithms and robust data protection. Policymakers, educators, and technologists must be in a joint effort to see that GAI is used justly. Democratized education, lifelong learning, and inclusive future promises GAI as they blend technology with pedagogy to reap maximum benefits and risks.","Suganya, S.; Kavitha, A.R.; D, Sahana",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICDSAAI65575.2025.11011822,ordn5an2qr,,,,"2025 International Conference on Data Science, Agents &amp; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (ICDSAAI), Data Science, Agents &amp; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (ICDSAAI), 2025 International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250328,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Robotics and Control Systems; Ethics; Technological innovation; Translation; Metaverse; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Transforms; Chatbots; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; System analysis and design; metaverse; CHATGPT; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Adaptive Learning; personalized learning platform","Shaping The Future of Education with Generative AI: Potential, Challenges, and Opportunities",
"The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) presents profound ethical challenges within African universities/higher educational institutions. This article examines the dual discourse adopted by university lecturers in Cameroon and Benin through a qualitative inquiry. The findings reveal three major insights: the deployment of strategies of justification, denial, and avoidance that underscore a persistent tension between institutional norms and actual practices; the prevalence of fear and institutional strain, exacerbated by insufficient training and apprehensions regarding technological dependency; and the lack of clear regulatory frameworks, which further entrenches ambiguity in stakeholders' positions.","KADJI-NGASSAM, Martial; NKAKLEU, Raphaël; SIYOU, Emmanuel; MATEMB, Florent",Business Source Ultimate,,10.3917/mav.148.0091,6n5xnm4mvf,,,148,Revue Management et Avenir,,115,91,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=6n5xnm4mvf&recordId=6n5xnm4mvf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,Management Prospective Editions,"Universities &amp; colleges; Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; College teachers; Higher education; Ambiguity",Comprendre le double discours des enseignants d'universités africaines face aux usages des IA génératives: une approche par la dissonance éthique.,

"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can create sophisticated textual and multimodal content readily available to students. Writing intensive courses and disciplines that use writing as a major form of assessment are significantly impacted by advancements in generative AI, as the technology has the potential to revolutionize how students write and how they perceive writing as a fundamental literacy skill. However, educators are still at the beginning stage of understanding students' integration of generative AI in their actual writing process. This study addresses the urgent need to uncover how students engage with ChatGPT throughout different components of their writing processes and their perceptions of the opportunities and challenges of generative AI. Adopting a phenomenological research design, the study explored the writing practices of six students, including both native and nonnative English speakers, in a first-year writing class at a higher education institution in the US. Thematic analysis of students' written products, self-reflections, and interviews suggests that students utilized ChatGPT for brainstorming and organizing ideas as well as assisting with both global (e.g., argument, structure, coherence) and local issues of writing (e.g., syntax, diction, grammar), while they also had various ethical and practical concerns about the use of ChatGPT. The study brought to front two dilemmas encountered by students in their generative AI-assisted writing: (1) the challenging balance between incorporating AI to enhance writing and maintaining their authentic voice, and (2) the dilemma of weighing the potential loss of learning experiences against the emergence of new learning opportunities accompanying AI integration. These dilemmas highlight the need to rethink learning in an increasingly AI-mediated educational context, emphasizing the importance of fostering students' critical AI literacy to promote their authorial voice and learning in AI-human collaboration.",Chaoran Wang,ERIC,,10.1007/s10758-024-09744-3,ekisox7j55,,,3,"Technology, Knowledge and Learning",,1846,1825,,True,20250901,,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Computer Uses in Education; Writing (Composition); Writing Processes; Student Attitudes; Technology Integration; Writing Attitudes; Computer Attitudes; Freshman Composition; College Freshmen; Native Speakers; Non English Speaking; Brainstorming; Persuasive Discourse; Text Structure; Rhetoric; Syntax; Pronunciation; Grammar; Ethics; Critical Literacy; Digital Literacy,Exploring Students' Generative AI-Assisted Writing Processes: Perceptions and Experiences from Native and Nonnative English Speakers,30
"There is a heightened concern over undergraduate students being over-reliant on Generative AI and using it recklessly. Reliance behaviours describe the frequencies and ways that people use AI tools for tasks such as problem-solving, influenced by individual factors such as trust and AI literacy. One way to conceptualise reliance is that reliance behaviours are affected by the extent to which learners consciously evaluate the relative performance of AI and humans, suggesting the potential impacts of critical thinking on reliance. This study, thus, empirically investigates the relationship between critical thinking and reliance behaviours. Critical thinking includes disposition and skills. However, limited empirical studies have investigated how critical thinking influences learners' reliance behaviours when solving problems with Generative AI. Hence, the current study conducted path analyses to investigate how critical thinking is associated with reliance behaviours and how it mediates the effect of individual factors on reliance behaviours. We collected 808 survey responses on critical thinking disposition and skills, reliance behaviours (a self-developed and validated scale, including reflective use, cautious use, thoughtless use, and collaborative use), trust towards AI, and AI literacy from undergraduates after a problem-solving task with Generative AI. The results indicate that (1) critical thinking is positively associated with the collaborative, reflective, and cautious use of Generative AI, suggesting that these three types of use of Generative AI could be considered desirable behaviours in human-AI problem-solving; (2) trust positively predicts thoughtless use; (3) critical thinking can offset the influence of trust on collaborative, reflective and cautious use; and (4) critical thinking can amplify the influence of AI literacy on reflective, cautious and collaborative use. This study contributes new insights into understanding the role of critical thinking in fostering desirable reliance behaviours, including reflective, cautious and collaborative use, and provides implications for future interventions when applying Generative AI for problem-solving.",Chenyu Hou; Gaoxia Zhu; Vidya Sudarshan,ERIC,,10.1111/bjet.13613,t6g2janx7v,,,5,British Journal of Educational Technology,,1941,1919,,True,20250901,,Undergraduate Students; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Student Behavior; Incidence; Critical Thinking; Thinking Skills; Problem Solving; Technology Uses in Education; Trust (Psychology); Problem Based Learning; Flipped Classroom; Foreign Countries; Technological Literacy; Cooperation; Asia,The Role of Critical Thinking on Undergraduates' Reliance Behaviours on Generative AI in Problem-Solving,56
"This study explores the role of generative AI (GenAI) in business decision-making among Generation Z (Gen Z), transitioning from AI-driven consumer behaviours to strategic professional applications. While Gen Z is highly proficient in using AI for personalized recommendations in consumer settings, their ability to critically engage with AI for complex decision-making in workplace environments remains a challenge. Through an experimental study, this research evaluates how Gen Z interacts with AI tools when selecting enterprise software solutions. Findings indicate that Full-Process Assistance approaches yield the most effective results, whereas Identification and Comparison approaches exhibit gaps in justification and iterative refinement. Additionally, AI's evaluation mechanisms sometimes misclassify decision success, highlighting the need for structured AI literacy programs and enhanced AI assessment frameworks. The study underscores the necessity of integrating AI literacy into educational curricula and refining AI tools to support Gen Z professionals in making informed, strategic business decisions. Future research should focus on AI-human hybrid decision models to ensure AI serves as a collaborative tool rather than an unquestioned authority in professional environments.","Belludi, Suraj; Kopackova, Hana",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ZINC65316.2025.11103526,bzf5e7kg2z,,,,"2025 IEEE Zooming Innovation in Consumer Technologies Conference (ZINC), Zooming Innovation in Consumer Technologies Conference (ZINC), 2025 IEEE",,124,119,,True,20250528,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Technological innovation; Consumer behavior; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Decision making; Refining; Employment; Software; Iterative methods; Zinc; Business; <mark>AI</mark>-assisted decision-making; Generation Z",Beyond AI-Powered Shopping: Can Gen Z Apply Generative AI for Business Decision?,
"This study examines the impact of the fishbone digital Learning Design (FDLD) approach on engineering curriculum design and explores the role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) as a peer evaluator.

"With the prevalence of generational artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life, there has been a recent increase in research on individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards generational AI. However, with the breadth of use cases and applications made available with the advancements in large language models (LLMs), there are increasing signs that attitudes towards LLM-based generative AI may be context or use-case dependent. We examine the contextualised trust of individuals in AI, the support for using AI, and AI adoption intentions in a survey experiment ($\mathrm{N}=306$) across three contexts (reasons): technical, mental health, and creative assistance. Participants read ostensible news articles about AI use in one of these three contexts, and completed a survey on their resultant and previous attitudes. The results show that trust and adoption were significantly higher for technical assistance, and lower for creative assistance and mental health assistance. However, support for using AI for mental health assistance was significantly higher than creative assistance, and comparable to technical assistance. Contextualised trust and support also significantly predicted AI adoption intentions, above and beyond trust scores towards AI in general. Our study suggests that contextualised attitudes towards specific AI products appear to be sufficiently differentiated from (general) AI attitudes, and instances where AI is used for technical reasons, as opposed to creative or mental health reasons, garners more favourable attitudes.","Liew, Kongmeng; Wu, Xiaoli; Zhang, Zhouqing",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CAI64502.2025.00051,ciz64m5woz,,,,"2025 IEEE Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (CAI), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (CAI), 2025 IEEE Conference on, CAI",,6,1,,True,20250505,IEEE,Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Signal Processing and Analysis; Surveys; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Buildings; Mental health; Assistive technologies; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Trust; Support; Adoption Intentions; Experiment; Social Psychology,"Trust, Support, and Adoption Intentions Towards Generative AI are Context Dependent",

"Characterizing the 3D complex energy materials interface is critical to understand the correlative relationship between performance, degradation, and structures. Unfortunately, the resolution of microscopy and image acquisition speed are limited by the nature of the hardware, causing high‐throughput characterization of energy materials to be prohibitive. Herein, REMind, a generative diffusion artificial intelligence model for fast and accurate reconstruction of electrode microstructures via focused ion beam‐scanning electron microscopy, is presented. REMind can generate high‐resolution internal microstructures between two low‐resolution surfaces after training on sufficient high‐resolution microstructures, enabling larger milling thickness between slices while keeping high‐fidelity imaging. REMind is first demonstrated for reconstructing solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode microstructures. REMind resolves relevant multi‐scale structures with low pixel‐wise reconstruction error (&lt;10%) and quantifies the generated uncertainty by calculating the generated entropy. Additionally, a multi‐scale multi‐physics SOFC model is employed to further quantify the reconstructed error regarding the electrochemical performance, i.e., operating current density versus overpotential. REMind shows good transferability, as proven by its ability to reconstruct other energy materials, including catalyst layers of proton exchange membrane fuel cells and solid‐state battery composite electrodes, demonstrating the potential for REMind to be used as a general‐purpose platform for broad development of energy technology.","Niu, Zhiqiang; Zhou, Zhaoxia; Perrenot, Patrice; Villevieille, Claire; Zhao, Wanhui; Cai, Qiong; Pinfield, Valerie J.; Wang, Yun",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1002/smsc.202500414,cap4pjdmij,,,,Small Science,,,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=cap4pjdmij&recordId=cap4pjdmij&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250923,Wiley-Blackwell,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Solid oxide fuel cells; Electrochemical analysis; Three-dimensional imaging; Microelectrodes; High resolution imaging; Electrodes,Seeing the Middle: Reconstructing 3D Internal Electrode Microstructures from Low‐Resolution Surfaces with Generative Diffusion Artificial Intelligence.,
"This study examined the ethical implications and challenges to academic quality of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in university teaching. A documentary analysis of secondary sources was conducted, including academic articles, international guidelines, and institutional reports published between 2023 and 2025. The global findings indicate that, while GAI offers opportunities to personalize learning, its use entails critical risks such as automated plagiarism, misinformation due to ""algorithmic hallucinations,"" and the weakening of cognitive competencies. At the institutional policy level, recent research indicates that more than 63% of universities globally already promote responsible use and nearly 50% have implemented guidelines on the subject. Ecuador's personal data protection legislation currently presents deficiencies in the regulation of artificial intelligence in education. This lack of regulations is a consequence of the lack of any regulations in the 2021 Organic Law on Personal Data Protection. Furthermore, an examination of the 2021-2025 Territorial Development and Planning Plan (PDI) of the Milagro State University reveals a lack of regulations governing the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in classrooms and assessment processes. The institution adopts these technologies solely as a response to the need to comply, without a formal framework to guide them.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has opened new possibilities for designing learning analytics (LA) tools, gaining new insights about student learning processes and their environment, and supporting teachers in assessing and monitoring students. This systematic literature review maps the empirical research of 41 papers utilizing GenAI and LA and interprets the results through the lens of the LA/EDM process cycle. Currently, GenAI is mostly implemented to automate discourse coding, scoring, or classification tasks. Few papers used GenAI to generate data or to summarize text. Classroom integrations of GenAI and LA mostly explore facilitating human-GenAI collaboration, rather than implementing automated feedback generation or GenAI-powered learning analytics dashboards. Most papers use Generative Adversarial Network models to generate synthetic data, BERT models for classification or prediction tasks, BERT or GPT models for discourse coding, and GPT models for tool integration. Although most studies evaluate the GenAI output, we found examples of using GenAI without the output validation, especially when its output feeds into an LA pipeline aiming to, for example, develop a dashboard.

"This study examines researchers' ethical concerns toward the deployment of GenAI in research and their emotional responses. To acquire an in-depth understanding, we used narrative frames and follow-up interviews to collect data from 22 researchers who reported extensive experience with GenAI. An inductive thematic analysis revealed three themes capturing ethical concerns that invoked three types of emotional reactions. From an ethical perspective, our participants were concerned with ""human ethical agency in AI research practices,"" ""cognitive impacts of overreliance on GenAI in research,"" and ""ethical issues of access, accuracy, and privacy."" From an emotional perspective, they showed ""mixed emotions,"" ""positive emotions,"" and ""negative emotions"" when dealing with GenAI tools. There were close connections between the ethical implications of GenAI and the emotional reactions to them. In this light, we conclude that emotional reactions to GenAI, which are determinants of future use, should be taken more seriously in further research.","Farangi, Mohamad Reza; Nejadghanbar, Hassan; Hu, Guangwei",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1080/10508422.2024.2420133,4yaztl7kwr,,,7,Ethics &amp; Behavior,,543,527,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=4yaztl7kwr&recordId=4yaztl7kwr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251001,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Qualitative research; Interviewing; Statistical sampling; Privacy; Emotions; Descriptive statistics; Thematic analysis; Sound recordings; Research; Trust; Medical ethics; Iran; Marketing Research and Public Opinion Polling; Integrated Record Production/Distribution; Record Production; Sound recording merchant wholesalers,Use of generative AI in research: ethical considerations and emotional experiences.,35
"Generative AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs), is integrated into societal contexts in Africa, including in higher education. Many students, teachers, and educational administrators use these technologies daily for various purposes. This paper examines the opportunities and challenges of integrating generative AI into the higher education systems in Africa. The discussion is grounded in practical testing of TurkuEval at the University of Namibia. This LLMbased platform allows students to study learning materials, answer related questions, and receive AI-generated grading and feedback on their responses. Teachers can review and validate the AI's grading and feedback, thus creating a complementary approach for using LLMs in higher education. Pre-evaluation, evaluation, and postevaluation steps are essential to ensure a systematic and secure LLM use for evaluating students' written work.

"The process of visual inspection has been significantly improved with addition of AI with human in the loop. In this paper, we introduce new features to enhance our end–to‒end visual inspection framework for HBMs. We detect individual HBMs consisting of multiple components along with providing a full report for the scanned chip providing 3D metrology information, details on defects and possible root cause analysis for the defects. Our modular approach can integrate any object detection and segmentation deep learning model based on the inspection requirements. We introduce a multi-view approach to increase the robustness of the detection and identification framework for defective bumps. Our approach can directly process high-resolution 3D scans and generate automatically an inspection report from our generative AI model. On our HBM dataset, the defective bump identification increased by 46%. We also conduct a study on learning with less labels. With varied percentages of labeled data, we achieved segmentation accuracy of 87% on memory bumps respectively with only utilizing 25% labelled bumps for training our AI models. The Inspection reports are customized using our 3D Metrology toolbox and Large Language Models (LLMs) providing possible causes and suggestions. We then propose a fully automated system, that with one click is able to provide a comprehensive report of the entire dense 3D scan consisting of more than 400 bumps in under 5 minutes.

"Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is becoming a key technology in 6 G networks, where sensing based on channel state information (CSI) plays an essential role. Present research primarily focuses on enhancing sensing performance, yet often overlooks security issue, especially the threat of unauthorized sensing that tends to receive little attention. In response to the above threat, this paper proposes to use generative AI to enhance the security of CSI-based sensing systems. Specifically, we design the guarding signal according to the characteristics of CSI fluctuations caused by user activities and build the corresponding database based on the measurements collected by software-defined radio. Utilizing the constructed dataset, we train the conditional generative diffusion model, which can produce guarding signals that are similar yet distinct from the original training samples. Then, these guarding signals are modulated onto pilot signals, effectively masking the user-induced fluctuations, thereby preventing unauthorized devices from performing illegitimate sensing. Taking the user activity recognition as the example, experimental evaluations illustrate that the proposed method reduces the recognition accuracy of unauthorized devices by about 75 %, significantly enhancing user privacy protection against unauthorized sensing.","Wang, Jiacheng; Feng, Chenyuan; Sun, Geng; Du, Hongyang; Niyato, Dusit; Quek, Tony Q.

To achieve this, a series of independent variables are defined such as GPU Memory Access, Memory Bandwidth, Throughput, Power Consumption, Temperature, and Clock Speed. With the RBF algorithm, these sub-metrics are analyzed taking into consideration the number of units that may be in each of the hidden layers and the level of importance of the variable, while, with the MLP, the number of units established both in hidden layer 1 and 2, respectively, and the importance level and normalized importance to analyze the behavior of these sub-metrics.

"Mood journals support emotional self-reflection and awareness, but sustaining user motivation remains a challenge. CRAFTJAI, a gamification-driven AI framework, enhances the journaling experience by integrating generative AI, transforming diary entries into AI-generated visual mood characters to make the process more interactive and expressive. By incorporating gamification principles from Self-Determination Theory and the Octalysis model, CRAFTJAI emphasizes motivation and personalization to encourage long-term engagement. It employs LLMs for mood analysis and character generation, while LoRA fine-tuning enhances text-to-image synthesis, improving visual coherence and emotional expressiveness. The evaluation assessed five criteria: unpredictability and curiosity, diary alignment, style consistency, meaning and calling, and ownership and possession, demonstrating an 8% overall improvement over the baseline. The most significant gains were observed in diary alignment and style consistency, validating the effectiveness of fine-tuning in enhancing emotional representation and visual coherence. A real-world study further evaluated engagement across five key metrics: anticipation, motivation to collect, sense of accomplishment, community sharing, and long-term engagement, all mapped to gamification principles. Results strongly supported the fine-tuned method, with all metrics surpassing 80%, confirming its effectiveness in sustaining user motivation.

"Design thinking (DT), widely recognized as a structured method for fostering creativity and innovation, has gained significant traction in research and practice across various disciplines. However, with the rise of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), DT practices are gradually evolving, reshaping the innovation process. This study investigates the effectiveness of integrating generative AI into a product design thinking activity, employing a single-group pretest-posttest design (i.e., without a control group). The time interval between pretest and posttest measurements was four hours, coinciding with the duration of the DT activity. Conducted in a chemical engineering course at a private university in central Mexico, the research tasked nine students of average academic performance with designing a new beverage. Over a four-hour session, students used AI tools-ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini-at various stages of the design process, including empathy mapping, need statements, idea classification, hills writing, and storyboarding. Several multidimensional constructs were measured using self-report questionnaires to assess the key attributes that DT stimulates: perceptions of creative self-efficacy, design thinking mindset, and empathy. Additionally, the study explored students' views on the usefulness of generative AI and their intention to use such tools. It was hypothesized that post-test scores for each construct would increase. The analysis involved two phases: first, psychometric indicators (alpha reliability) were obtained; second, a statistical approach for assessing individual change was applied, precisely the standardized individual difference (SID). The SID was set at a nominal level of 0.80 (right tail of the normal distribution).

"In an era where technology plays a significant role in the lives of people of all ages, adapting to rapidly advancing technology is essential. Lifelong learning, which integrates formal, non-formal, and informal education, helps learners develop skills and abilities independently. Programming skills serve as an example of lifelong learning, requiring the development of technical skills such as programming, planning, and testing, as well as communication, teamwork, and systematic thinking. This research focuses on utilizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) to enhance programming skills through self-directed learning combined with interactive learning. The study was conducted with 21 students enrolled in the Higher Vocational Certificate (Diploma) program in Mechatronics and Robotics. The study applied the MAR model, which consists of three stages: The motivation stage, is designed to encourage learners to engage in activities that link prior knowledge or experiences with new knowledge, thereby fostering self-directed learning motivation, such as designing personalized learning activities based on individual interests; the Activity stage, which provides opportunities for learners to use Generative AI technology for self-directed learning according to their goals and plans, enabling them to understand concepts, apply knowledge in various situations, and track their learning progress; and the Reflection and Progress stage, focusing on reviewing, analyzing, and reflecting on learning outcomes, as well as exchanging ideas and skills with peers and receiving constructive feedback. These stages were designed based on theoretical foundations and a literature review. Furthermore, the research emphasized ethical considerations in AI use, such as data privacy and societal impacts, to promote high-quality, beneficial lifelong learning. The findings showed that before the learning process, the learner had no background in programming and had never used AI technology. However, after participating in the learning activities, students became more open to learning and responded positively to the self-designed activities, which aligned with their interests and skills related to their field of study. These findings suggest that this learning process, when implemented effectively, can be applied to lifelong learning for individuals of all genders and ages.","Puttajanyawong, Nuttapon; Suamuang, Wuttiporn; Chomsuwan, Komkrit",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016488,wabmf4izkn,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,9,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Systematics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Reflection; Teamwork; Planning; Programming profession; Robots; Testing; Systematic literature review; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Self-Directed Learning; Interactive Learning,Utilizing Generative AI to Develop Programming Skill Through Self-Directed and Interactive Learning,
"Generative AI (GAI) can be leveraged to good effect in engineering, technology, and computing (ETC) classrooms but with pre-conditions; among these include teacher preparedness. One dimension of teacher preparedness is knowing how GAI is used in classrooms like their own. This paper responds to that need. The paper surveys the literature to answer three questions: in formal instructional interventions, what were the tasks for which GAI was used; what methods did scholars use to evaluate the GAI instructional set; and what were some of the identified challenges and opportunities regarding the use of GAI in ETC classrooms? Taking account of quality and recency of scholarship, and the need to focus on ETC practices, a rapid review of IEEE FIE conference proceedings for 2023 and 2024 was undertaken. Of the 1,181 papers published in both conference proceedings, and after a two-stage screening process, 20 papers were selected for synthesis. Of the 20 papers examined in this review, we found seven patterns of research design. The most common was the learning and teaching intervention followed by gathering student feedback. While we expect that a bigger corpus will yield additional research designs, these seven provide a start for defining a typology of research design investigating student use of GAI. The review revealed eight distinct categories of use ranging from software development, the most common, with over 26 distinct tasks, to data classification and data analysis, each with two distinct tasks. GAI was found to be used for many low-cognitive tasks like generating bibliographies to cognitivelydemanding uses like design and modeling. The studies reported recurring concerns about using GAI, like perpetuating bias, and hallucinations. One striking empirical finding is that previous ways of accomplishing ETC tasks, like using MATLAB and hand analysis, may be quicker and easier than using GAI. The scholarship advocates for broad and deep GAI literacy programs, addressing GAI abilities, limitations, ethics of use, and prompt design. Moreover, instructors are encouraged to be GAI literate themselves. This know-how is central to designing meaningful GAI-based tasks which seek to prepare students for an increasingly AI-infused world and workplace.","Mohammed, Crista; Sarjusingh, Wayne; Rocke, Sean",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016366,skw2t5cbbf,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,7,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Surveys; Hands; Ethics; Reviews; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Scholarships; Employment; Engineering education; MATLAB; Software development management; engineering education; engineering; technology and computing education; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>,"Uses of Generative AI in Engineering, Technology, and Computing Classrooms: Findings From the IEEE FIE Conference Proceedings",
"Generative AI has emerged as a transformative tool in the realm of higher education, offering a wealth of opportunities for personalized learning, automated feedback, and enhanced collaboration. However, its successful adoption within university environments is significantly dependent on the trust it earns from its users, particularly students. This study investigates the levels of trust and the adoption of Generative AI among students enrolled in both German and international study programs at Hochschule Bielefeld (HSBI) and its transnational partner, Hainan Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences (BiUH). Utilizing a comprehensive questionnaire, the research explores students' perceptions of the trustworthiness of Generative AI, their usage patterns, and their concerns regarding the ethical and academic implications of its use. Preliminary findings suggest that while students widely recognize the potential of Generative AI to improve learning outcomes and efficiency, the degree of trust in its reliability and fairness varies significantly. Key factors influencing this trust include the transparency of AI systems, the perceived accuracy of outputs, and concerns about bias and misuse. Students in international and cross-cultural programs face additional challenges, such as language barriers and cultural differences, which affect how AI is perceived and utilized. Ethical concerns, particularly regarding plagiarism and academic integrity, are prevalent across all groups, underscoring the need for clear institutional guidelines and policies. The findings highlight the importance of fostering AI literacy and providing support structures to build trust and encourage responsible use. Recommendations include the implementation of transparent AI tools, tailored training programs, and the development of ethical guidelines to ensure that Generative AI enhances education while upholding academic standards. This research provides actionable insights for universities aiming to integrate Generative AI into diverse educational contexts, ensuring that it serves as a beneficial tool that complements traditional educational methods while preparing students for a future where AI plays an increasingly central role.","Zhang, Yue; Reusch, Pascal",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016490,75fqzhdb3f,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Ethics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Plagiarism; Learning automata; Reliability; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Engineering education; Standards; Guidelines; trust; university education; adoption; academic integrity; <mark>AI</mark> literacy,"Trust in and Adoption of Generative AI in University Education: Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications",
"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is emerging as a transformative force that empowers transnational education (TNE) in engineering. Recent trends indicate a significant shift in the application of generative AI in engineering policies, academic research, business practices, and educational settings throughout TNE. Governments and organizations are transitioning from restrictive stances to developing guiding frameworks for its application, enabling cross-border collaboration in TNE. Numerous universities have permitted and even promoted the utilization of GAI. Furthermore, academic research around the world is looking into the pros and cons of GAI in engineering education, focusing on how it can help teachers and keep students interested. Industrial applications are diversifying, extending across disciplines, and TNE is occurring in engineering contexts, including cross-border programs. GAI possesses the capacity to transform TNE by revolutionizing talent development, reformulating engineering models, and facilitating scientific assessment across multinational frameworks. However, problems like the generative illusion, ethical and ideological risks, lack of trust between teachers and students, and new threats to TNE in engineering equity in global settings require substantial focus. This study examines these concerns and outlines potential strategies to leverage GAI for transnational education in engineering, offering stakeholders the opportunity to prioritize AI literacy among educators and learners. This work emphasizes that cross-disciplinary and collaborative R&amp;D, following national and international standards, should tackle application hurdles while guaranteeing safety and inclusion. This study also addresses several future directions that can contribute to creating a unified framework and cost-effective solutions. These solutions, integrated with platforms like the National Smart Education Platform, can bridge digital divides, ensuring equitable access and enabling global TNE stakeholders to capitalize on the GAI revolution. We also provide several statistics and case studies to show the effectiveness of GAI over TNE in engineering and provide practical solutions for the incorporation of GAI into TNE within engineering frameworks, guaranteeing inclusivity and equity.","Haider, Sami Ahmed; Ahmad, Khwaja Mutahir; Akbar, Jehan; Soni, Mukesh; Keshta, Ismail; AlGhamdi, Azzah; Shahzadi, Hafiza Mahrukh",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016469,5s5w6wmypf,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,8,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Ethics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Catalysts; Collaboration; Transforms; Market research; Safety; Stakeholders; Engineering education; Research and development; Transnational Education; ChatGPT; Technological Factors; Intelligent Computing; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>,"Generative AI as a Catalyst for Transforming Transnational Engineering Education: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Directions",

"Developing teamwork skills and creativity is becoming increasingly important in higher education. Brainstorming activities can support the acquisition of such transversal skills by encouraging open dialogue in collaborative design processes. In a successful brainstorming, participants propose diverse ideas, combine them, and elaborate new propositions by taking inspiration in the propositions of their teammates. However, the cognitive effect of idea fixation may hinder this process. Idea fixations happens when participants focus on a limited set of ideas and are unable to think about unrelated alternatives. This effect lowers the creativity of the group and prevents the participants to consider diverse aspects of the problem at hand, which is an important mechanism in design-based learning. Leveraging the recent development in Large Language Models (LLM), we propose to integrate a Generative-AI agent to introduce new ideas into a brainstorming process supported by a digital application. Such agent can be designed to bring new topics to be considered that the students may not have brought up themselves. Our study aims to examine how such AI-generated ideas may influence the ideas proposed anonymously by the participants, and ultimately, the outcome of the activity. We use a quasi-experimental design with two conditions: one in which only the students generate ideas (control), another where they receive AI-generated ideas along with their own. We conduct this experiment as a part of a design thinking project carried out by computer science students. Using a qualitative coding combined with Epistemic Network Analysis, we investigate the dissemination of the topics brought by the Generative-AI agent within the ideas of the participants. We also present and discuss practical aspects of the intervention and its implementation by educators in their teaching. Our findings are contributing to the understanding of humanAI interactions in the context of collaborative ideation in educational settings. They can inform the design of new interaction mechanisms with AI agents to support creativity. Furthermore, by introducing previously unconsidered topics to these activities, these AI-based agents can support groups of students in considering a wider range of aspects of the matter at hand, supporting the development of critical thinking. These mechanisms may be useful to educators and facilitators looking for solutions to overcome idea fixation and increase creativity in brainstorming.","La Scala, Jeremy; Sahli, Sonia; Gillet, Denis",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016340,dhkydsfrq5,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Hands; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Heuristic algorithms; Large language models; Network analyzers; Encoding; Teamwork; Particle swarm optimization; Engineering education; Creativity; human-<mark>AI</mark> collaboration; design thinking; critical thinking; ideation; epistemic network analysis,Stimulating Brainstorming Activities with Generative AI in Higher Education,
"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is profoundly reshaping the educational ecosystem, driving the transition of education into a new era characterized by ""human-machine"" collaborative evolution. In this context, cultivating innovative talents with ""machine-irreplaceable"" capabilities has become increasingly imperative, as critical thinking, creativity, and related competencies are now regarded as essential attributes for college students in the intelligent era. Nevertheless, the impact of GAI on students' creativity remains a subject of debate within academia, with no consensus on whether it enhances or undermines creative potential. To address this gap, this study investigated the influence of the generative AI tool Kimi AI on creativity among 113 college students, utilizing a single-factor between-subjects experimental design. Creativity was operationalized through scores obtained from an alien-drawing task, a widely recognized measure of divergent thinking. The results demonstrate that GAI, when employed as a ""learning companion,"" facilitates sustained interaction with students, thereby effectively fostering the development of their creative abilities. As the transition from weak AI to strong AI progresses, a critical challenge in the intelligent era lies in determining how to effectively integrate GAI into educational frameworks to enhance not only creativity but also other core competencies essential for future-ready graduates.","Liu, Hui; Zhou, Fuyu; Li, Jiahuan",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSTE64638.2025.11091881,m6xxg2k6d5,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), 2025 7th International Conference on",,665,661,,True,20250418,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computer science; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Human-machine systems; Education; Ecosystems; Collaboration; Creativity; <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; creativity; GAI; higher education",Empower or Disempower: The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on College Students' Creativity,

However, GenAI models with billions of parameters require substantial memory capacity and computational power for deployment and execution, presenting significant challenges to resource-limited edge networks. In this paper, we address the joint model caching and resource allocation problem in GenAI-enabled wireless edge networks. Our objective is to balance the trade-off between delivering high-quality AIGC and minimizing the delay in AI GC service provisioning. To tackle this problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning approach, capable of efficiently determining optimal model caching and resource allocation decisions for AIGC services in response to user mobility and time-varying channel conditions.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the landscape of three-dimensional (3D) printing by enabling generative approaches that extend beyond conventional, parameter-tuning strategies. Rather than merely adjusting nozzle temperatures or speeds, modern AI models can create or refine Gcode paths themselves, seeking to balance objectives such as print strength, dimensional accuracy, and defect minimization. This paper introduces a holistic AI-driven workflow for automated Gcode generation. We demonstrate that generative Large Language Models (LLMs) can parse, synthesize, and optimize printing instructions, thus offering an alternative to human-engineered slicing parameters. Our approach incorporates a continuous feedback loop in which a predictive model evaluates each generated Gcode script for potential print outcomes. Experimental results illustrate strong correlations between the number of lines in generated Gcode and key performance metrics (tensile strength, defect rate, and dimensional accuracy). Notably, some scripts with fewer lines reduced material defects yet slightly degraded dimensional accuracy, while more complex scripts improved measurement fidelity but also introduced minor flaws. These findings illuminate the trade-offs in AI-driven 3D printing and highlight the method's capacity for ongoing improvement. By exploring future expansions, such as continuous-function printing trajectories and multi-material prints, this study shows that AI-based Gcode generation can significantly advance 3D printing quality and customization across diverse applications.","Haque, Sean; Tanveer, Muhammad Hassan; Voicu, Razvan Cristian",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/SoutheastCon56624.2025.10971689,7al4gzcymj,,,,"SoutheastCon 2025, 2025, SoutheastCon",,1287,1282,,True,20250322,IEEE,"Aerospace; Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas; Engineering Profession; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Geoscience; Nuclear Engineering; Photonics and Electrooptics; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Solid modeling; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Machine learning; Predictive models; Three-dimensional printing; Minimization; Trajectory; Optimization; 3D Printing; Gcode; Machine Learning; Print Optimization; <mark>AI</mark> Generated 3D Models; Additive Manufacturing",AI-Driven 3D Printing: Generative Gcode for Quality and Efficiency,
"This paper proposes a personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence, which aims to improve students' learning efficiency and interest through adaptive learning paths and content recommendations. The system integrates advanced artificial intelligence technologies such as GAN and VAE to achieve deep customization and dynamic adjustment of the learning process. First, the GAN model is used to generate personalized learning resources, including courseware, exercises and learning paths, which are dynamically adjusted according to students' knowledge mastery and learning styles. VAE is used to construct a latent space representation of students' learning status and further optimize the personalized recommendation of learning content. To verify the effectiveness of the system, this paper conducted many simulation experiments. By analyzing the learning behavior data of different student groups, the system's performance in personalized recommendation and learning progress adaptation was evaluated. The experimental results show that the personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence has significant advantages in improving students' learning effects, shortening learning time, and increasing learning participation. Specific data show that the recommendation accuracy of the system reaches 92%, the learning efficiency is improved by 15%, and the student satisfaction is 20% higher than the traditional learning model.","Zhou, Chu",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EESPE63401.2025.10986914,2jy52lp4an,,,,"2025 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Energy Systems and Power Engineering (EESPE), Electronics, Energy Systems and Power Engineering (EESPE), 2025 IEEE International Conference on",,1008,1004,,True,20250317,IEEE,"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Learning systems; Courseware; Power engineering; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; System performance; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Real-time systems; Data models; Recommender systems; Personalized learning system; <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; GAN; VAE",Design and Implementation of Personalized Learning System Based on Generative Artificial Intelligence,

"This paper presents two pedagogical approaches for teaching in the era of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), using case studies from mathematics and computer science. As Generation Z and Alpha have grown up immersed in technology, their learning styles differ significantly from previous generations, creating challenges for traditional instructional methods. While digital platforms provide flexibility, accessibility, and interactivity, the rapid advancement of generative AI adds new layers of complexity. These AI tools enhance self-learning and problem-solving but also raise concerns about ethical usage and conceptual depth. Building on existing research, we introduce two methods: one based on a “learning how to learn” approach in mathematics, which emphasizes mathematical reasoning and problem interpretation over procedural mastery, and another for integrating AI into computer science to support problem-solving, software development, and data-driven decision-making. Preliminary results suggest that students using these approaches demonstrate a stronger ability to leverage AI responsibly, critically assess its outputs, and apply it across disciplines. These findings highlight the need for curriculum adaptations that foster critical thinking, ethical awareness, and adaptability in the AI-driven future.","Thida, Myo; Landi, Amanda",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ISEC64801.2025.11147331,vdghsa7qwr,,,,"2025 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC), Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC), 2025 IEEE",,5,1,,True,20250315,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Computer science; Ethics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Navigation; Education; Decision making; Mathematics; Problem-solving; Software development management; STEM; STEM Education; Gen Z and Alpha; Ethical <mark>AI</mark>",STEM Education in the Age of Generative AI: Case Studies in Teaching Mathematics and Computer Science to Generation Z and Alpha,

"Personalized learning has significantly enhanced teaching practice through its development to cater to varied learning needs and in its full utilization of learner engagement. Traditional practice, in contrast, is limited by fixed content, minimum learner flexibility, and minimal immediate feedback. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces a revolution through self-generated adaptive learning material such as customized tests, interactive simulations, and adaptive lesson plans. This article presents a systematic review on the use of Generative AI in education, synthesizing what has been published on its contributions to learning achievement based on empirical studies. Studies conducted by AI-powered platforms like Khan Academy's AI tutor and Duolingo's adaptive questions indicate a 26-38% boost in student engagement, a 34% boost in learning retention, and a 40% decrease in teacher workloads. Additionally, current evidence shows that adaptive learning models implemented using AI cut dropout rates by 22% and improved evaluation accuracy through live automated feedback. Despite these advantages, data confidentiality, algorithm bias, and material reliability concerns continue to exist. This paper fills this gap through the discussion of ethical AI platforms, the usage of open-sourced datasets in minimizing bias, and Explainable AI (XAI) as a means for transparency. Moreover, it explores hybrid AI-human models of education, scalability of AI-powered education in developing regions, and policy recommendations for affordable education. By integrating existing research, this paper also contributes to the body of knowledge on AI-facilitated personalized learning and its implications for learning in the future.","Puvvadi, Meghana; Arava, Sai Kumar; Santoria, Adarsh; Chennupati, Sesha Sai Prasanna; Puvvadi, Harsha Vardhan",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICISS63372.2025.11076239,6mfsnswekz,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS), Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS), 2025 7th International Conference on",,1627,1621,,True,20250312,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Ethics; Adaptive learning; Data privacy; Adaptation models; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Explainable <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Transforms; Systematic literature review; Personalized Education; Adaptive Learning; <mark>AI</mark> Ethics; Multimodal Learning",Generative AI for Personalized Learning and Education,

"Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) provides a ubiquitous coverage to user equipments (UEs) but it is also susceptible to interference. Rate-splitting (RS) effectively extracts data by decoding interference, yet its effectiveness is limited by the weakest UE. In this paper, we investigate an RS-based CF massive MIMO system, which combines strengths and mitigates weaknesses of both approaches. Considering imperfect channel state information (CSI) resulting from both pilot contamination and noise, we derive a closed-form expression for the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system under a spatially correlated Rician channel. Moreover, we propose low-complexity heuristic algorithms based on statistical CSI for power-splitting of common messages and power-control of private messages, and genetic algorithm is adopted as a solution for upper bound performance. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem, aiming to maximize the sum SE of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system by optimizing the power-splitting factor and power-control coefficient. Importantly, we improve a generative AI (GAI) algorithm to address this complex and non-convexity problem by using a diffusion model to obtain solutions. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality in mitigating interference, especially in dynamic environments.","Zheng, J.; Zhang, J.; Du, H.; Zhang, R.; Niyato, D.; Dobre, O.A.; <mark>Ai</mark>, B.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCOMM.2024.3469542,hdspcho6cv,,,4,"IEEE Transactions on Communications, Communications, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) presents transformative opportunities for educational environments, yet adoption within higher vocational education remains constrained by multifaceted barriers. While existing research has explored Gen AI applications across educational domains, limited attention has focused on understanding adoption hesitancy among higher vocational students who face unique considerations regarding practical skill development and workplace preparation. This study employed a quantitative approach using a cross-sectional survey of 312 vocational students across three colleges in China, examining concerns related to academic integrity, security risks, privacy, cognitive dependency, and information reliability. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between key adoption barriers, indicating these concerns function as interconnected constructs rather than isolated factors. Cluster analysis identified three distinct student typologies: Conditional Acceptors, AI Skeptics, and Receptive Potentials, demonstrating heterogeneity in pre-adoption attitudes despite no prior Gen AI experience. Principal component analysis further confirmed Gen AI resistance is structured along two fundamental dimensions: Cognitive-Security concerns and Ethical-Informational integrity. This study illuminates the complex topology of Gen AI resistance prior to actual engagement, providing educational institutions with insights for developing differentiated approaches that address varying levels of student resistance while ensuring implementation occurs within appropriate ethical, cognitive, and security frameworks.","Lin, Jie; Lin, Jing; Luo, Xin",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICAIE64856.2025.11158361,22sriqoh2b,,,,"2025 5th International Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Education (ICAIE), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> and Education (ICAIE), 2025 5th International Conference on",,508,504,,True,20250514,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Resistance; Surveys; Ethics; Privacy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Topology; Security; Reliability; Faces; Principal component analysis; Higher Vocational Education; Technology Adoption Barriers; Student Perceptions; Educational Technology,Barriers to Generative AI Adoption Among Higher Vocational Students: Understanding Hesitancy and Resistance,

"As artificial intelligence (AI) transforms workplaces, understanding how future graduates engage with AI technologies is crucial for enhancing employability. This study investigates higher education students' familiarity with and perceptions of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in their learning. Using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and incorporating personal innovativeness in information technology, we examined factors influencing students' adoption of GenAI. An online survey was conducted between April 30 and May 11, 2024, with 233 students from a college in northern Israel completing the questionnaire. Results revealed significant positive correlations, supporting the study's theoretical framework. Personal innovativeness was strongly related to TAM variables. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude toward use and behavioural intention to use the technology were each significant predictors of actual GenAI use. Gender and field of study influenced adoption, with both males and students studying information systems and economics showing higher usage rates. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to integrate TAM with personal innovativeness and demographic factors to assess student engagement with GenAI. The findings provide a theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding student responses to new technologies in higher education. The identified gender gap and field-based differences suggest that tailored approaches are necessary to enhance student engagement with GenAI tools. Overall, the findings imply that teaching practices should include scaffolded, inclusive strategies that foster GenAI literacy, adaptability and ethical awareness.

"This paper examines how UNESCO's ""Guidance for Generative AI in Education and Research"" uses personification metaphors to describe artificial intelligence and how these linguistic choices shape public understanding of AI's educational role. Through critical discourse analysis, we identify personification metaphors that attribute human characteristics to AI: biological traits, cognitive abilities, and leadership qualities. These metaphors make technology appear more relatable while risking overly optimistic, techno-deterministic perspectives. These metaphors also construct a narrow educational future where AI serves as an essential teaching partner, potentially encouraging over-dependence while reducing critical human oversight. Our analysis reveals three key concerns: framing AI as an autonomous entity capable of substituting human educators in resource-limited contexts could inadvertently widen existing disparities; language influences how institutions integrate AI technologies; and educational discourse needs more expansive and critical perspectives on AI's appropriate role. The findings highlight the necessity for nuanced discussions about AI in education that acknowledge both opportunities and limitations.",Bruna Damiana Heinsfeld; George Veletsianos,ERIC,,,6zhqzs5wff,,,1,Journal of Interactive Media in Education,,,,,True,20250101,,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Figurative Language; International Organizations; Language Usage; Computer Uses in Education,The Language on GenAI: A Critical Exploration of Personification Metaphors in UNESCO's Guidance for Generative AI in Education and Research,2025
"This paper explores how Donald Schön's concept of generative metaphor can serve as a conceptual frame for problematising AI in education. Our focus is on the metaphor of AI as autotune for knowledge, as originally proposed by educator Dave Cormier. Through a close reading and exploration of the metaphor, we draw on Schön's conceptual materials to surface underlying assumptions and reframe key issues at play in Cormier's story. We show that the autotune metaphor, while intuitively appealing, oversimplifies the analogy between autotune as a tool for professional music-making and the relationship between expertise and use of AI tools. Drawing on a more nuanced view of autotune in music production, we elicit several points of conflict with Cormier's original metaphor to generate a richer problematisation of issues posed by AI in education.",Jack Walton; Dave Cormier,ERIC,,,jpr6ycs27r,,,1,Journal of Interactive Media in Education,,,,,True,20250101,,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Technology Uses in Education; Expertise; Figurative Language; Literary Devices; Barriers,Autotune for Knowledge: A Generative Metaphor for AI in Education,2025
"This paper presents the findings of a pilot study on the use of generative AI (GAI) in tutorial sessions within a large-scale distance education institution in Indonesia. The primary aim of the experiment was to assess the impact of GAI-based tutoring on student engagement and academic achievement. A secondary objective was to explore how GAI could reduce the workload of human tutors by automating routine tasks, such as responding to frequently asked questions and providing initial feedback, thereby allowing human tutors to concentrate more on moderation and higher-order teaching tasks. The development team adopted a modular design approach, utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT models (versions 3.5 and 4.0) and integrating them with the Moodle learning management system. The resulting system consisted of three core modules: Management, LMS Integration, and Backend. These modules enabled efficient administration, seamless integration with the existing learning platform, and effective generation of AI responses for student interactions. The study involved data collection from four online courses with a total of 37,743 students. The results indicated that students in GAI-assisted classes participated more actively in discussion forums and achieved slightly higher scores in their assignments compared to those in non-GAI-assisted settings. These findings suggest that GAI-based tutor assistants can provide considerable enhancements in online learning environments, particularly in fostering engagement and improving student outcomes.

After solving mathematical problems, they were given an assignment to pose and refine additional problems in accordance with the curriculum requirements by giving ""prompts"" to the AI environment and refining them as needed. In this paper, we focus on the qualitative analysis of three key stages experienced by the teachers: writing the initial prompt to request assistance from ChatGPT to improve the problem; the response provided by ChatGPT; and the teachers' reflections on how they utilized ChatGPT's recommendations to update and refine their problem. This analysis reveals that the chat's responses and the teachers' reactions to them made several key contributions to improving mathematical problems, particularly by enhancing the clarity of the problem and increasing its challenge and complexity. Additionally, it improved mathematical precision and showed how it could be linked to real-world applications, thereby increasing student engagement. The chat also encouraged inquiry-based thinking and provided guidance for helping struggling students. Overall, these contributions significantly enhanced the quality of the mathematical problems and improved their TPACK (theoretical, pedagogical, and content knowledge).",Yaniv Biton; Ruti Segal,ERIC,,,2qdk2kvq6b,,,1,"International Journal of Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology",,223,202,,True,20250101,,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Natural Language Processing; Technology Uses in Education; Preservice Teachers; Mathematics Teachers; Pedagogical Content Knowledge; Technological Literacy; Problem Solving; Skill Development; Mathematics Instruction; High School Teachers; Advanced Courses; Editing; Revision (Written Composition); Mathematical Concepts,Learning to Craft and Critically Evaluate Prompts: The Role of Generative AI (ChatGPT) in Enhancing Pre-Service Mathematics Teachers' TPACK and Problem-Posing Skills,13

"Leaders can't afford to take a ""wait and see"" approach to adopting generative AI. They need a plan for applying it differently than others in the value chain, say the authors. In this article they introduce a framework for thinking about gen AI strategically and offer practical advice on how to apply gen AI to the tasks composing jobs. The framework focuses on two factors: the cost of errors and the type of knowledge required. If an error in carrying out a task would lead to serious harm, financial loss, or reputational damage, firms must be cautious about employing gen AI to perform it without human oversight. Tasks that rely on explicit data (information that can be captured and processed) are well suited for gen AI. But other tasks are fundamentally harder for it to perform because they involve not just retrieving information but also applying tacit knowledge: empathy, ethical reasoning, intuition, and contextual judgment. Placing the tasks in the appropriate quadrant makes it clear which ones gen AI can handle faster, cheaper, or better.","Anand, Bharat N.; Wu, Andy",Business Source Ultimate,,,au5mqp7flf,,,6,Harvard Business Review,,129,118,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=au5mqp7flf&recordId=au5mqp7flf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,False,20251101,Harvard University,Business enterprises; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Tasks; Tacit knowledge; Reasoning; Ethics; Intuition; Judgment (Psychology),The Gen AI Playbook for Organizations.,103
"Companies eager to adopt generative AI often launch numerous pilots across departments, chasing quick wins and marginal efficiencies. But a scattershot approach won't deliver transformative impact. The global consumer packaged goods company Reckitt took a different approach. It chose to go deep in one domain—marketing—where gen AI could be applied across interconnected tasks like insight generation, content creation, and product development. The lesson? To unlock gen AI's full potential, organizations should resist the urge to experiment broadly and instead go deep and narrow—concentrating efforts where scale and synergy can drive meaningful change. They should begin by selecting a single strategic domain where gen AI can be applied across interconnected tasks. They should then build on existing strengths—such as data assets or technical capabilities—to scale AI adoption meaningfully. By rethinking core processes within that domain and aligning teams around transformation rather than experimentation, companies can unlock deeper insights, accelerate innovation, and achieve measurable impact.","Challagalla, Goutam; Khan, Mahwesh; Beaulieu, Fabrice",Business Source Ultimate,,,m4qhks7sor,,,6,Harvard Business Review,,99,90,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=m4qhks7sor&recordId=m4qhks7sor&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,False,20251101,Harvard University,Business enterprises; Marketing; Strategic planning; Creative ability in business; Innovation management; Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC; Marketing Consulting Services; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>,Stop Running So Many AI Pilots.,103

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping advertising, communication and media agencies, enhancing operational efficiency and creativity. These agencies, central to the media business and brand management across all industries, have transitioned from their traditional roles to digital marketing consultants, with AI significantly influencing this evolution in co-creating value. At the same time, AI also bears the risk of co-destruction. This paper examines AI's current deployment, and its potential future impact based on a survey of 108 decision-makers from German agencies. Results show varied AI adoption across different types of agencies and specific aspects of the overall value creation process, while the orchestration of AI deployment still appears to be in an experimental stage.

"This study assessed the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) usage on the academic outcomes of engineering students within the context of Yemen's unique socioeconomic challenges. This study employed a quantitative approach through a structured 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire, which was distributed to 277 engineering students from Taiz University, Yemen. In a resource-constrained environment, the results exhibited a strong correlation between GenAI usage and engineering students’ overall grades and skills development. Additionally, findings showed that socioeconomic challenges that students face in Yemen have moderately hindered students from the effective usage of GenAI for educational purposes, which is a key finding for higher education institutions (HEIs). Also, statistical results showed that almost all respondents are familiar with GenAI tool usage, while 89.17% use ChatGPT as a fundamental component of learning. Of course, the integration of GenAI into education has become inevitable, compelling HEI policymakers to regulate its use and formally adopt it as a primary source of learning systems. Students and educators should obtain continuous training to effectively benefit from GenAI while conforming to ethics and boosting their intellectual capabilities and skills. Raised concerns that the students overreliance on AI tools could undermine their problem-solving abilities and practical skills development while complicating students’ evaluation process for educators. The outcomes of this study could serve as a foundational reference for policymakers, educators, and students in Yemen and similar settings.

"Generative AI has flourished over the past decade, with generative models advancing in both the industrial and academic sectors. Given various applications, some scenarios have seen the misuse of generative AI, particularly in the integration with the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT devices often handle personal and sensitive data, raising serious concerns about privacy leakage and security breaches when generating data. As a promising countermeasure, machine unlearning has emerged to solve the problems posed by these generative models by effectively removing specific concepts or sensitive information from trained models. In this survey, anchored in generative models, machine unlearning approaches are reviewed, categorized, and discussed comprehensively and systematically. Existing unlearning approaches are classified into gradient-based techniques, task vectors, knowledge distillation, data sharding, and reliable unlearning methods. Apart from previous works, this survey extends the review of attack methods that aim to exploit the vulnerability in generative models and assess the robustness of these unlearning methods. In addition, popular metrics and datasets in machine unlearning research are summarized and evaluated based on effectiveness, efficiency, and security. Finally, we shed light on the future directions of this emerging research topic by discussing applications, highlighting challenges, and exploring research frontiers for the current machine unlearning community and the new investigators to come.","Huang, A.; Cai, Z.; Xiong, Z.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JIOT.2025.3570989,csnqxih3bz,,,16,"IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, IEEE Internet Things J.",,32580,32563,,True,20250815,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Data models; Surveys; Security; Internet of Things; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Law; Computational modeling; Training; Taxonomy; Generators; machine unlearning; security and privacy; the Internet of Things (IoT)","A Survey of Machine Unlearning in Generative AI Models: Methods, Applications, Security, and Challenges",12
"With the development of the sixth generation (6G) networks, ubiquitous intelligence, computing, and networking integration, low energy consumption, and low delay have become the key characteristics. These characteristics pose significant challenges for traffic scheduling, particularly in the context of intelligent computing services. In recent years, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated remarkable performance not only in natural language processing and image generation but also in network optimization. This article presents a generative AI-endogenous three-layer network architecture, named GenNet, to support more efficient scheduling of intelligent computing services in 6G networks by the dynamic adaptation of heterogeneous computing resources and diversified service requirements. Moreover, we propose a dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN)-based transmission scheduling algorithm that leverages diffusion models to achieve cross-domain end-to-end deterministic transmission. The proposed algorithm facilitates efficient interaction between edge devices and intelligent computing centers while reducing system cost and delay, and utilizes the denoising capability of the diffusion model to adaptively configure networks and optimize resource allocation.

"Transformer-based generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models achieve remarkable results in a wide range of fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. However, this comes at the cost of increased complexity and the need of sophisticated non-linearities such as softmax and GELU. Even if Transformers are computationally dominated by matrix multiplications (MatMul), these non-linearities can become a performance bottleneck, especially if dedicated hardware is used to accelerate MatMul operators. In this work, we introduce a GenAI BFloat16 Transformer acceleration template based on a heterogeneous tightly-coupled cluster containing 256KiB of shared SRAM, 8 general-purpose RISC-V cores, a $24\times 8$ systolic array MatMul accelerator, and a novel accelerator for Transformer softmax, GELU and SiLU non-linearities: SoftEx. SoftEx introduces an approximate exponentiation algorithm balancing efficiency ( $121\times $ speedup over glibc’s implementation) with accuracy (mean relative error of 0.14%). In 12 nm technology, SoftEx occupies 0.039 mm 2 , only 3.22% of the cluster, which achieves an operating frequency of 1.12 GHz. Compared to optimized software running on the RISC-V cores, SoftEx achieves significant improvements, accelerating softmax and GELU computations by up to $10.8\times $ and $5.11\times $ , respectively, while reducing their energy consumption by up to $10.8\times $ and $5.29\times $ . These enhancements translate into a $1.58\times $ increase in throughput (310 GOPS at 0.8 V) and a $1.42\times $ improvement in energy efficiency (1.34 TOPS/W at 0.55 V) on end-to-end ViT inference workloads.","Belano, A.; Tortorella, Y.; Garofalo, A.; Benini, L.; Rossi, D.; Conti, F.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JETCAS.2025.3562734,t2yd54r7mr,,,2,"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, IEEE Journal on, IEEE J.

"In the decade, artificial intelligence has achieved great popularity and applications in medicine and healthcare. Various AI-based algorithms have shown astonishing performance. However, in various data-driven smart healthcare algorithms, the problem of incomplete dataset remains a huge challenge. In this paper, we propose a data completeness enhancement algorithm based on generative AI (i.e., GenAI-DAA) to solve the problems of the in-sufficient data for model training, the data imbalance, and the biases of the training samples. We first construct the cognitive field of the generative models and effectively understand the state of incomplete cognition in generative models. Secondly, on this basis, we propose a quest algorithm for abnormal samples in the cognitive field based on local outlier factor. By fine-grained value evaluation, abnormal samples are given more refined attention. Finally, integrating the above process through multiple cognitive adjustments, GenAI-DAA gradually improves the cognitive ability.

"Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics and bioinformatics, including tasks such as identifying bioactive compounds of interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic compounds with desirable material properties, or organizing large chemical libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed classification rules, or are deep learning methods that lack explainability. This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO). We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our results against deep learning models and a naive SMARTS pattern based classifier. C3PO outperforms the naive classifier, but does not reach the performance of state of the art deep learning methods. However, C3PO has a number of strengths that complement deep learning methods, including explainability and reduced data dependence. C3PO can be used alongside deep learning classifiers to provide an explanation of the classification, where both methods agree. The programs can be used as part of the ontology development process, and iteratively refined by expert human curators. Scientific contribution: We demonstrate a novel knowledge distillation technique in which the classifiers are programs, leveraging the power of cheminformatics software libraries. We demonstrate applicability for classifying chemical structures, and for assisting curation of chemical databases.","Mungall, Christopher J.; Malik, Adnan; Korn, Daniel R.; Reese, Justin T.; O'Boyle, Noel M.; Hastings, Janna",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1186/s13321-025-01092-3,jtt6nwxcdr,,,1,Journal of Cheminformatics,,23,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=jtt6nwxcdr&recordId=jtt6nwxcdr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20251001,Springer Nature,"<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Cheminformatics; Knowledge transfer; Chemotaxonomy; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Molecular structure; Bioinformatics; Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology); Research and Development in Biotechnology",Chemical classification program synthesis using generative artificial intelligence.,17

"With the rising availability and support of geospatial data and tools, geospatial data analysis is increasing rapidly. However, geospatial data is challenging to extract and understand by individuals with limited or no prior knowledge of handling such data. This study presents a novel platform that integrates generative artificial intelligence (Gen. AI) and prompt engineering techniques for geospatial data retrieval and analysis. This is achieved by firing natural language queries and integrating a generative pre-trained transformer GPT-3.5 for data retrieval and analysis. The platform translates unstructured natural language inputs into structured Overpass API queries, retrieving detailed geospatial data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The system streamlines the process, from query to visualization, enabling users without technical geospatial expertise to access spatial information seamlessly. It supports geospatial data retrieval tasks such as Point of Interest (PoI) extraction, proximity queries, and attribute-based retrieval. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing tools such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), GeoGPT, GeoInsight, MapQA, OSM-GPT with an average query-execution time of 17.3 seconds and an average accuracy of 95%. It shows a significant improvement in usability over manual Overpass query construction. The proposed framework achieves higher performance while maintaining a lightweight design that does not require model fine-tuning or external training data. Unlike existing tools that heavily rely on fine-tuned transformers with tightly coupled components, the proposed framework is modular, prompt-driven, and API-based, which enables its rapid deployment and minimal resource usage. This lightweight architecture helps to improve system maintainability, scalability, and makes it easily accessible for real-time applications and end-users with limited technical infrastructure.

"The increasing use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Perplexity and Gemini opens up new possible scenarios for supporting work and everyday activities. For people who are blind, the usability of such tools through screen readers is crucial to ensure their use of such AI-based technologies. In this study, we explore the accessibility and usability of the interfaces of four popular AI-based tools via screen readers through a combination of semi-automated evaluations and inspections conducted by both sighted and blind accessibility experts and screen readers with more than 20 years of experience. Navigation, labeling of control elements, feedback mechanisms, and prompt handling were considered in the study. The results point to usability difficulties in all tools, particularly in navigation structure, clarity of feedback and interactive elements. Although this work empirically explores the accessibility of AI-based tools it brings out the first critical issues that deserve further investigation.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has profoundly reshaped how graduate students conceptualise, design and conduct academic research in higher education. While current metrics predominantly focus on technology acceptance and usage patterns, they often neglect the diverse cognitive engagements in graduate students' integration of GenAI across academic research activities. This study developed and validated a novel scale, grounded in the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework, to measure the integration of GenAI in academic research by graduate students. The scale development followed rigorous procedures beginning with a systematic literature review to create initial items, which were refined through expert reviews and pilot testing. Subsequently, two samples were created using data from 1216 Chinese graduate students across five disciplines (Arts and humanities, Social sciences, Science, Engineering, Medicine). For Sample 1, item-total correlation analysis and exploratory factor analysis were conducted, revealing four distinct factors: Passive, Active, Constructive and Interactive. Sample 2 was used for confirmatory factor analysis and validity testing. The finalised 27-item ICAP GenAI Scale exhibited excellent model fit, high reliability, robust construct validity and demographic invariance. This empirically validated tool not only advances our understanding of human-AI collaboration in academic research but also has significant implications for enhancing the research capabilities and higher-order thinking of graduate students in the AI-driven era.",Jianzhen Zhang; Weihao Pan; Xiaoyu Liang; Jiahao Ge,ERIC,,10.1111/ejed.70209,w72vmasehf,,,3,European Journal of Education,,,,,True,20250901,,Foreign Countries; Graduate Students; Measures (Individuals); Student Research; Research Methodology; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Technology Integration; Educational Research; Test Construction; Humanities; Social Sciences; Engineering; Medicine; Sciences; Intellectual Disciplines; Factor Analysis; Test Validity; Test Reliability; Goodness of Fit; Construct Validity; Research Skills; China,Development and Validation of the ICAP GenAI Scale to Measure How Graduate Students Integrate Generative AI into Academic Research,60
"This paper reports on a design-based research (DBR) study that aims to devise an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered teachable agent that supports secondary school students' learning-by-teaching practices of mathematics learning content. A long-standing pedagogical practice of learning-by-teaching is powered by a recent advancement of generative AI technologies, yielding our teachable agent called ""ALTER-Math."" This study chronicles one usability testing and three cycles of iterative design and implementation process of ""ALTER-Math."" The three empirical studies involved a total of 320 middle school students and six teachers in authentic classroom settings. The first study was exploratory, focusing on the qualitative feedback from the students and teachers through open-ended surveys, interviews and classroom observations. The second study yielded a medium-high (M = 3.26) quantitative survey result on students' perceived engagement and usability on top of the qualitative findings. Finally, the final study included pre- and post-knowledge tests in a quasi-experimental study design as well as student and teacher interviews. The final study revealed a bigger significant knowledge improvement in students who used ""ALTER-Math"" compared to the control group, suggesting a positive impact of AI-powered teachable agents on students' learning.

"This study explores the role of generative AI (GenAI) in providing formative feedback in children's digital learning experiences, specifically in the context of mathematics education. Using multimodal data, the research compares AI-generated feedback with feedback from human instructors, focusing on its impact on children's learning outcomes. Children engaged with a digital body-scale number line to learn addition and subtraction of positive and negative integers through embodied interaction. The study followed a between-group design, with one group receiving feedback from a human instructor and the other from GenAI. Eye-tracking data and system logs were used to evaluate student's information processing behaviour and cognitive load. The results revealed that while task-based performance did not differ significantly between conditions, the GenAI feedback condition demonstrated lower cognitive load and students show different visual information processing strategies among the two conditions. The findings provide empirical support for the potential of GenAI to complement traditional teaching by providing structured and adaptive feedback that supports efficient learning. The study underscores the importance of hybrid intelligence approaches that integrate human and AI feedback to enhance learning through synergistic feedback.

"Generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT have found prominence in recent times with their ability to generate texts, images, etc. Several questions pertaining to ethical and legal issues surrounding ChatGPT have arisen. In this paper, I discuss the nature and background of generative AI, situating its development in the historical context of AI. I then discuss my primary research questions: is sufficient attention paid in the literature on ethics of AI to the principle of beneficence and is there theoretical clarity on its meaning? I highlight that while there is great deal of discussion on what harms can arise from generative AI and how to stop them, there is very little discussion on what amounts to AI-for-good, particularly in the literature of AI ethics and regulation. To the extent that such discussion exists, it pushes ahead with suggesting specific solutions, without fully addressing the underlying question of what makes their prescriptions beneficent. I demonstrate that the principle of beneficence as understood in biomedical ethics and human rights frameworks has limited utility for the ethics of generative AI. These gaps in the AI regulation are prominent, as they can derail long term progress of generative AI and the realization of its full potential.","Singh Chauhan, Krishna Deo",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1080/13600869.2024.2364989,tapwwz7diz,,,2,"International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology",,174,152,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=tapwwz7diz&recordId=tapwwz7diz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,"<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Bioethics; ChatGPT; Research questions; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)",ChatGPT for good?

"The implementation of next-generation networks has the potential to unleash the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). However, integrating GAI with the next-generation networks introduces a significant challenge in managing the limited resources of edge devices. In this paper, we propose a resource optimization framework for GAI in next-generation networks to address this issue. In this study, we focus on the optimization of system utility as minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and delay. In particular, we develop a hierarchical soft actor-critic with an intrinsic curiosity (HSAC-IC) algorithm to determine the task scheduling strategy. The HSAC-IC algorithm utilizes a hierarchical strategy structure and an intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) to improve learning efficiency and performance, particularly in environments characterized by sparse rewards, high-dimensional action spaces, and complex tasks. Our simulations benchmark the HSAC-IC algorithm against two existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and three reference schemes.

"Given the imminent introduction of Reduced Capability (RedCap) devices in 5G networks, the computational and communications limitations of these devices note new challenges for network slicing. Adaptive network slicing is required to optimize resource allocation and to maintain quality of service (QoS) across the wide variety of scenarios encountered in RedCap use cases. Finally Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) represents a promising way forward: we use it to predict network conditions, effect automatic slice reconfiguration, and govern flexible resource distribution. In this paper, we look into the handicap of genai models such as generative opposition networks (GANS) and variationally autoencoders (VAEs) assisted network slicing for RedCap enabled 5G networks. Synthetic network traffic patterns can be created by GenAI, allowing it to forecast congestion and adjust slice parameters ahead of time on the basis of what it has learned. A reinforcement learning-driven network model lends itself to real-time decision-making, which will improve spectral efficiency, lowers delays, and will result in optimized power consumption. This paper presents a framework that applies GenAI to handle slice elasticity. If network conditions were changing, be in the future or in the middle of a task, this would ensure the operation of services with minimal interruption. The method was evaluated by simulation and found to be successful in dynamically balancing traffic loads and maintaining QoS levels in RedCap scenarios. Our work demonstrates that adaptive slicing driven by GenAI greatly enhances network efficiency, making 5G RedCap deployments more robust and scalable.","Rajakakarlapudi, Rajeev Varma; Vadisetty, Rahul",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ASSIC64892.2025.11158600,vwvss2rwjv,,,,"2025 International Conference on Advancements in Smart, Secure and Intelligent Computing (ASSIC), Advancements in Smart, Secure and Intelligent Computing (ASSIC), 2025 International Conference on",,4,1,,True,20250516,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Robotics and Control Systems; Wireless communication; Wireless sensor networks; Adaptive systems; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; 5G mobile communication; Network slicing; Decision making; Quality of service; Telecommunication traffic; Resource management; Adaptive Network Slicing; RedCap 5G; <mark>AI</mark>-driven Optimization; Resource Allocation",Generative AI for Adaptive Network Slicing in RedCap 5G Networks,
"Nowadays, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly making inroads in Data Centers, helping to improve aspects related to latency and high speed. Data center-level network infrastructures require managing large volumes of data using high-speed protocols such as InfiniBand, as it allows low latency and parallel processing, as well as various applied switches at different network architecture levels. In this article, we examine those protocols at the data communication level that GenAI uses to optimize and guarantee data flow between nodes, as well as the design and reference of network architectures in the field of GenIA. On the other hand, the components of the GenAI networks used are analyzed. Similarly, a case study is proposed where the performance of the Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) is analyzed based on the definition of a series of metrics such as memory access, memory bandwidth, throughput, energy consumption, temperature, and clock speed, and that through the simulation of neural networks specifically using the Radial Basic Function (RBF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms, it helps to understand and analyze to what extent these metrics behave and generate possible solutions in the field of data centers.","Castillo, Antonio Cortes",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/IRASET64571.2025.11008109,il4mkxaos5,,,,"2025 5th International Conference on Innovative Research in Applied Science, Engineering and Technology (IRASET), Innovative Research in Applied Science, Engineering and Technology (IRASET), 2025 5th International Conference on",,9,1,,True,20250515,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Signal Processing and Analysis; Measurement; Data centers; Protocols; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Optical switches; Memory management; Graphics processing units; Bandwidth; Throughput; Servers; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; data centers; protocols; network architectures; graphic processing units; metrics",Data Center Infrastructure in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence,
"This paper deals with data pseudonymization when using generative artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT. The aim of the research was to experimentally verify whether ChatGPT can maintain the protection of pseudonymized data by not maintaining the link between the anonymized part and personal data. Four requests were tested in the experiment, in which ChatGPT was gradually provided with various combinations of pseudonymized and complete data about customers and their orders. The results showed that ChatGPT does not store previous inputs and is not able to reconstruct personal data retroactively if they were not explicitly provided to it in each request. Based on the results obtained, it can be assumed that the use of ChatGPT when processing pseudonymized data does not pose a risk of violating the protection of personal data.

"The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) among teenagers has led to significant misuse and safety concerns. To identify risks and understand parental controls challenges, we conducted a content analysis on Reddit and interviewed 20 participants (seven teenagers and 13 parents). Our study reveals a significant gap in parental awareness of the extensive ways children use GAI, such as interacting with character-based chatbots for emotional support or engaging in virtual relationships. Parents and children report differing perceptions of risks associated with GAI. Parents primarily express concerns about data collection, misinformation, and exposure to inappropriate content. In contrast, teenagers are more concerned about becoming addicted to virtual relationships with GAI, the potential misuse of GAI to spread harmful content in social groups, and the invasion of privacy due to unauthorized use of their personal data in GAI applications. The absence of parental control features on GAI platforms forces parents to rely on system-built controls, manually check histories, share accounts, and engage in active mediation. Despite these efforts, parents struggle to grasp the full spectrum of GAI-related risks and to perform effective real-time monitoring, mediation, and education.

"Generative AI coding tools are relatively new and their impact on developers extends beyond traditional coding metrics, influencing beliefs about work and developers' roles in the workplace. This study aims to illuminate developers' preexisting beliefs about generative AI tools, their self-perceptions, and how regular use of these tools may alter these beliefs. Using a mixed methods approach, including surveys, a randomized controlled trial, and a three-week diary study, we explored the real-world application of generative AI tools within a large multinational software company. We found that the introduction and sustained use of generative AI coding tools significantly increases developers' perceptions of these tools as both useful and enjoyable. However, developers' views on the trustworthiness of AI-generated code remained unchanged. We also discovered unexpected uses of these tools, such as replacing web search and fostering creative ideation. Additionally, 84% of participants reported positive changes in their daily work practices, and 66% noted shifts in their feelings about their work, ranging from increased enthusiasm to heightened awareness of the need to stay current with technology. This research provides both qualitative and quantitative insights into the evolving role of generative AI in software development and offers practical recommendations for maximizing the benefits of this emerging technology—particularly in balancing the productivity gains from AI-generated code with the need for increased scrutiny and critical evaluation of its outputs.","Butler, Jenna; Suh, Jina; Haniyur, Sankeerti; Hadley, Constance",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICSE-SEIP66354.2025.00034,occypuajln,,,,"2025 IEEE/ACM 47th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP), Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP), 2025 IEEE/ACM 47th International Conference on, ICSE-SEIP",,329,319,,True,20250427,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Surveys; Productivity; Technological innovation; Codes; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Employment; Encoding; Web search; Software engineering; Testing; GenAI; Software Engineering; Copilot,Dear Diary: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Generative AI Coding Tools in the Workplace,
"The increasing complexity of today’s industrial landscape poses a significant challenge for engineering education, creating a vast gap between the skills acquired by the students, the topics covered in the universities, and the skills required as per current industry demands. As the industry increasingly seeks to hire candidates with technical ability and the required skill set to solve real-world problems, traditional education and recruitment approaches struggle to keep up with the requirements. This misalignment is particularly evident in computer science and engineering, which is prone to rapid transformations, thus demanding an equally dynamic ecosystem. Generative AI (Gen AI), a subset of Artificial Intelligence, shows great promise in bridging the gaps between the three stakeholders: students, universities, and industry. We have leveraged Generative AI to attain the university curricula, align the student skills with the industry, and reshape the hiring and education process, which results in a well-collaborated ecosystem where students, universities, and industry are better aligned to serve each other’s interests.","Das, Pragya; Harshan; Harsha, C; Suman, Himanshu Kumar; Giri, Animesh",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/IC4e65071.2025.11075412,ytdh2h6ymj,,,,"2025 16th International Conference on E-Education, E-Business, E-Management and E-Learning (IC4e), E-Education, E-Business, E-Management and E-Learning (IC4e), 2025 16th International Conference on",,257,249,,True,20250426,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Industries; Ethics; Electronic learning; Automation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Ecosystems; Stakeholders; Engineering education; Usability; Recruitment; Engineering Education; Collaborative ecosystem; Recruitment automation; Curriculum attainment",Bridging Academia and Industry With Generative AI: A Platform for Dynamic Skill Development and Recruitment,

"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used by professionals and students to support creative tasks, raising ethical concerns about originality, and transparency. In this paper, we examine the interaction between developers of GAI models and design students, focusing on the nexus between ethics and functionality. Using a design class example, we show how GAI models can help students efficiently and responsibly explore design alternatives by quantitatively assessing their designs' novelty relative to the training data. Through the presented framework, it becomes apparent that the ethical use of GAI models will also require developers to implement specific network architectures. However, the joint interaction will greatly promote transparency in the creative process, support fair monetization of a student's intellectual property, and facilitate the development of high-quality training datasets for future GAI models.

"The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has been met with a mix of reactions by higher education institutions, ranging from consternation and resistance to whole-hearted acceptance. Previous work has looked at the discourse and policies adopted by universities across the U.S. as well as educators, along with the inclusion of GenAI-related content and topics in higher education. Building on previous research, this study reports findings from a survey of engineering educators on their use of and perspectives toward generative AI. Specifically, we surveyed 98 educators from engineering, computer science, and education who participated in a workshop on GenAI in Engineering Education to learn about their perspectives on using these tools for teaching and research. We asked them about their use of and comfort with GenAI, their overall perspectives on GenAI, the challenges and potential harms of using it for teaching, learning, and research, and examined whether their approach to using and integrating GenAI in their classroom influenced their experiences with GenAI and perceptions of it. Consistent with other research in GenAI education, we found that while the majority of participants were somewhat familiar with GenAI, reported use varied considerably. We found that educators harbored mostly hopeful and positive views about the potential of GenAI. We also found that those who engaged more with their students on the topic of GenAI, both as communi-cators (those who spoke directly with their students) and as incorporators (those who included it in their syllabus), tend to be more positive about its contribution to learning, while also being more attuned to its potential abuses. These findings suggest that integrating and engaging with generative AI is essential to foster productive interactions between instructors and students around this technology. Our work ultimately contributes to the evolving discourse on GenAI use, integration, and avoidance within educational settings. Through exploratory quantitative research, we have identified specific areas for further investigation.","Dewan, Umama; Hingle, Ashish; McDonald, Nora; Johri, Aditya",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016518,xh7tei2qrf,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Surveys; Resistance; Computer science; Ethics; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Shape; Conferences; Distance measurement; Engineering education; Lenses; teaching and research; higher education; engineering education,Engineering Educators' Perspectives on the Impact of Generative AI in Higher Education,
"Web frameworks have significantly changed how developers create web applications for the Internet. Thanks to pre-defined libraries, these frameworks not only accelerate development time but also reduce the amount of code developers need to write. However, to get the most out of the frameworks and libraries, developers need to have a deep understanding of core web programming languages. This allows them to write efficient code, troubleshoot effectively, and push the boundaries of what the frameworks can achieve. The same principle applies to Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, as they have the potential to enhance a developer's toolkit. However, they will only be useful if the developer has sound fundamental knowledge to verify the output from these tools. Educators in higher education face a similar predicament with the widespread use of Generative AI tools by learners. Many learners rely on these tools as a go-to solution without being able to verify or fully comprehend the output, leading to shallow understanding. The work in this paper outlines an approach used in a first-year web programming module within the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, where learners were encouraged to use Generative AI tools to stimulate critical thinking when conducting assessments. Specifically, GitHub CoPilot was used as a pair programmer, and ChatGPT served as a peer reviewer. In this context, the peer reviewer's role was to help the learner reflect on the tool's output. The aim of this study was to explore the design of active learning activities that incorporate Generative AI tools for web programming to foster critical thinking practices among learners. To evaluate our approach, we employed a critical thinking self-evaluation questionnaire instrument, where learners' opinions and customs were surveyed before and after both of the assignments.","Naeem, Usman; Styve, Arne; Virkki, Outi T.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016298,v7stbt2lxj,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,7,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Codes; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Instruments; Active learning; Chatbots; Libraries; Internet; Programming profession; Faces; Software development management; critical thinking; ChatGPT; GitHub CoPilot; web programming,Stimulating Critical Thinking in a Web Programming Module with Generative AI Tools,
"The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in smart microgrids introduces challenges related to demand-supply balance, energy forecasting accuracy, and optimal energy distribution. This paper proposes an AI-driven energy optimization framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the efficiency and reliability of smart microgrids. Unlike traditional optimization methods, GANs leverage adversarial learning to generate highly accurate energy demand forecasts and improve real-time energy dispatch. The proposed method was tested on a real-world smart microgrid dataset, integrating solar PV, wind turbines, and battery storage systems. Results demonstrate that the GAN-based approach improves energy demand prediction accuracy by 24.7% compared to conventional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and reduces energy storage inefficiencies by 14.8%. Furthermore, the optimization model enhances grid stability, achieving a 9.6% reduction in voltage fluctuations and a 12.3% decrease in peak load stress, thereby increasing overall microgrid efficiency. These improvements contribute to better energy sustainability, reduced operational costs, and enhanced grid resilience.

"As the global efforts to address climate change goals advance, the demand for renewable energy grows, and governments around the world actively promote low-carbon economies and green energy policies, the power system is undergoing profound changes. This transformation not only affects the mode of power production but also profoundly alters the way, focus, and technical means of power equipment asset management. The diversification of equipment types has increased management complexity, as new types of equipment such as photovoltaic inverters, wind turbine blades, and energy storage systems require specialized maintenance knowledge and technologies. To enhance the reliability and safety of power equipment, and reduce maintenance costs, this paper aims to explore the integration path of generative AI technology and the knowledge base of power equipment asset management, establish a knowledge base for the life cycle of asset equipment, adopt emerging generative AI information technology, and build an intelligent power asset equipment management question-answer platform to achieve intelligent management of various assets, thereby reducing unplanned downtime and improving the stability of power grid operation. Firstly, establish a knowledge base for power equipment management and combine it with the retrieval-augmented generation technology of generative AI to enable it to understand and generate professional knowledge and technical guidance related to power equipment. Then, deploy the application on a cloud platform and create an interactive intelligent assistant that can analyze emerging problems in real time and provide targeted solution suggestions. At the same time, it enables front-line technicians to quickly obtain effective help and support even when facing complex situations, they have never encountered before.","Qiu, Hui; Li, Zheng; Song, Weize",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ACPEE64358.2025.11040765,7hxsc43tfz,,,,"2025 10th Asia Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering (ACPEE), Power and Electrical Engineering (ACPEE), 2025 10th Asia Conference on",,166,161,,True,20250415,IEEE,"Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Costs; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Knowledge based systems; Retrieval augmented generation; Power system stability; Power grids; Asset management; Maintenance; Power system reliability; Safety; Asset equipment maintenance; intelligent assistant; retrieval-augmented generation",Generative AI Application in Power System Asset Management,
"Developing reliable healthcare AI models requires training with representative and diverse data. In imbalanced datasets, model performance tends to plateau on the more prevalent classes while remaining low on less common cases. To overcome this limitation, we propose DiffUltra, the first generative AI technique capable of synthesizing realistic Lung Ultrasound (LUS) images with extensive lesion variability. Specifically, we condition the generative AI by the introduced Lesion-anatomy Bank, which captures the lesion's structural and positional properties from real patient data to guide the image synthesis. We demonstrate that DiffUltra improves consolidation detection by 5.6% in AP compared to the models trained solely on real patient data. More importantly, DiffUltra increases data diversity and prevalence of rare cases, leading to a 25% AP improvement in detecting rare instances such as large lung consolidations, which make up only 10% of the dataset.","Chou, Yu-Cheng; Li, Gary Y.; Chen, Li; Zahiri, Mohsen; Balaraju, Naveen; Patil, Shubham; Hicks, Bryson; Schnittke, Nikolai; Parker, Maria; Kessler, David O.; Shupp, Jeffrey; Baloescu, Cristiana; Moore, Christopher; Gregory, Cynthia; Gregory, Kenton; Raju, Balasundar; Kruecker, Jochen; Chen, Alvin",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ISBI60581.2025.10980728,qzofwuq735,,,,"2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on",,5,1,,True,20250414,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Photonics and Electrooptics; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Ultrasonic imaging; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Image synthesis; Lungs; Object detection; Data models; Lesions; Reliability; Synthetic data; Synthetic data training; conditional diffusion model; lung consolidation; Video object detection,Ultrasound Image Synthesis Using Generative AI for Lung Consolidation Detection,
"Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) facilitates the real-time optical contrast for in vivo biomedical imaging. However, the detection noise is an inevitable byproduct of the real-time imaging process. Additionally, fluorescent probes currently approved for clinical use remain limited within the wavelength of NIR-IIa (1000–1300 nm). NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) imaging has the potential to deliver higher resolution than NIR-IIa, but relies on toxic fluorescent probes not approved for human use. To support clinical high-precision imaging, we propose a NIR-II fluorescence enhanced imaging method based on perception-enhanced spectrum shift generative adversarial network with explainable AI systems (xAI-PSSGAN). The proposed method tackles the problem of limited unpaired data training, and generates NIR-IIb resembling images with enhanced resolution and reduced noise. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method effectively improves the imaging quality and surpasses competing alternatives, which is of great significance to promote the high-quality NIR-II imaging in clinical practice.","Fu, Lidan; Lu, Binchun; Li, Lingbing; Shi, Xiaojing; Tian, Jie; Hu, Zhenhua",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ISBI60581.2025.10980871,hx5vxkdytb,,,,"2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on",,4,1,,True,20250414,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Photonics and Electrooptics; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Image resolution; Explainable <mark>AI</mark>; Statistical analysis; Noise; Imaging; Fluorescence; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Real-time systems; Probes; Biomedical image enhancement; cycle-consistent <mark>generative</mark> adversarial network; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; explainability; NIR - II imaging,XAI-PSSGAN: Perception-Enhanced Spectrum Shift Generative Adversarial Network with Explainable AI System for NIR-II Fluorescence Molecular Imaging,

"This paper presents a biometric identification system based on tongue print recognition with the help of machine learning techniques. The system is named Generative-AI-based Interpretation of Human Ultrametrics and Analysis (GIHUA). Traditional biometric systems like fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans suffer the challenges of computational complexity, forgery risks and age-related changes. Tongue print, on the contrary has the advantages that it remains unchanged throughout the life of a person, unaffected by trauma or diseases and is very difficult to forge, due to difficulty in its acquisition without the awareness of the individual. Tongue-print based systems mostly rely on image-based dataset whereas this work focuses on a numerical dataset which contributes to computational efficiency. GIHUA uses ultrametric distances to extract the features and this makes it ideal for applying directly into any machine learning model, regardless of being linear or non-linear. To overcome the scarcity of labeled tongue-print datasets, GIHUA creates synthetic labels with the help of K-means clustering and generative AI-based data augmentation technique. Classification is performed using random forest algorithm. Results show an accuracy of 99.10%, promising tongue print as an additional or alternative approach to biometric identification.","S, Anju Latha Nair; Nair, Athira S.; Sudhakar, Sunjith",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICTEST64710.2025.11042382,s373ivflwz,,,,"2025 2nd International Conference on Trends in Engineering Systems and Technologies (ICTEST), Trends in Engineering Systems and Technologies (ICTEST), 2025 2nd International Conference on",,5,1,,True,20250403,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Tongue; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Semisupervised learning; Feature extraction; Biometric identification; Market research; Numerical models; Security; Random forests; Synthetic data; Tongue print identification; machine learning; semi-supervised learning; ultrametric distance; synthetic data; identity verification; security systems",Generative AI based Interpretation of Human Ultrametrics and Analysis,1

"As cloud infrastructures become increasingly complex and integral to modern enterprises, the demand for advanced, real-time security solutions has grown significantly. Traditional anomaly detection systems often struggle to keep pace with the rapid evolution of cyber threats in these dynamic environments, particularly when faced with novel or sophisticated attacks. Such systems typically rely on predefined rules or signature-based detection, which limits their effectiveness in identifying emerging security risks. This paper explores the potential of generative AI models, specifically LLaMA and OpenAI’s GPT architectures, to enhance real-time cloud security. By leveraging the advanced pattern recognition and adaptive capabilities of these models, we propose a framework that can analyze vast amounts of cloud data, including logs, network traffic, user behavior, and system activities, to detect abnormal patterns indicative of security threats. The real-time anomaly detection offered by generative AI provides a significant advantage over traditional methods, as it continuously learns from new data, thereby improving its ability to identify novel threats in complex cloud environments.This research addresses key gaps in current cloud security practices, highlighting the limitations of existing systems in detecting previously unknown threats. The proposed approach introduces generative AI as a highly adaptive and scalable solution for cloud anomaly detection, capable of responding to evolving threats in real-time. By using models such as GPT, which are known for their ability to generate coherent predictions based on diverse inputs, the framework offers a novel means of safe-guarding cloud infrastructure. This study not only underscores the benefits of employing generative AI for security purposes but also provides a robust methodology for integrating these models into cloud security systems. The paper concludes with an assessment of the practical deployment of these AI models in large-scale cloud environments, demonstrating their potential to significantly enhance the resilience and adaptability of modern cloud security frameworks.","Akiri, Charan Kumar; Jayabalan, Kathiresan; Lopes, Joel; Kareem, Shaik Abdul; Tabbassum, Ayisha",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICCA65395.2025.11011269,d4ywmyxsiz,,,,"2025 IEEE Conference on Computer Applications (ICCA), Computer Applications (ICCA), 2025 IEEE Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250318,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Adaptation models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Cloud computing security; Scalability; Organizations; Telecommunication traffic; Real-time systems; Data models; Security; Anomaly detection; Real-time Anomaly Detection; Cloud Security; GPT and LLaMA Models; Zero-Day Attack Detection",Generative AI for Real-Time Cloud Security: Advanced Anomaly Detection Using GPT Models,

A novel multimodal mechanism is proposed to fuse base station positional information with Channel Frequency Response data, enabling the model to fully capture the spatial and spectral characteristics of the environment. Additionally, a feature embedding method is developed to integrate these multimodal inputs into the Transformer architecture effectively. By employing the Chamfer Distance as the loss function, EnvReconGPT ensures precise geometric alignment between predicted and ground truth point clouds, achieving robust performance across diverse scenarios. This work highlights the potential of generative AI in advancing ISAC systems and enabling wireless systems to meet the demands of the 6G Metaverse.","Yang, Tingting; Zhang, Ping; Zheng, Mengfan; Li, Nan; Ma, Shuai",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS65812.2025.11152849,ypfcvrft2f,,,,"IEEE INFOCOM 2025 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), IEEE INFOCOM 2025 - IEEE Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250519,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Wireless communication; 6G mobile communication; Point cloud compression; Wireless sensor networks; Metaverse; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Transformers; Integrated sensing and communication; Frequency response; Image reconstruction; <mark>generative</mark> pretrained transformer; integrated sensing and communication; wireless environment reconstruction",EnvReconGPT: A Generative AI Model for Wireless Environment Reconstruction in the 6G Metaverse,
"Driven by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), generative AI applications have become the dominant workload for the modern cloud. Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, NPUs, and TPUs, play a key role in AI adoption due to their superior performance over general-purpose CPUs. AI models and the data are often highly sensitive and come from mutually distrusting parties. Existing industry-standard CPU-based TEEs, such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV, do not adequately protect these accelerators. Device-TEEs like Nvidia-CC only address tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems with a proprietary solution requiring TEE on the host CPU side. On the other hand, existing academic proposals target specific CPU-TEE platforms. To address this gap, we propose Guardain,a confidential computing architecture for discrete NPU devices that requires no trust in the host system. Guardainsecures data, model parameters, and operator binaries through authenticated encryption. Guardainuses delegation-based memory semantics to ensure isolation from the host software stack, while task attestation guarantees strong model integrity. Our G Uardainimplementation and evaluation with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Llama2 and Llama3 shows that Guardainintroduces minimal overhead with no changes in the AI software stack.","Dhar, Aritra; Thorens, Clement; Lazier, Lara Magdalena; Cavigelli, Lukas",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/SP61157.2025.00221,3telx5qllb,,,,"2025 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), Security and Privacy (SP), 2025 IEEE Symposium on, SP",,4172,4155,,True,20250512,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Performance evaluation; Privacy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Large language models; Semantics; Full stack; Computer architecture; Data models; Proposals; confidential computing; <mark>ai</mark> accelerator,Guardain: Protecting Emerging Generative AI Workloads on Heterogeneous NPU,

"Providing rich, constructive feedback to students is essential for supporting and enhancing their learning. Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities to deliver scalable, repeatable, and instant feedback, effectively making abundant a resource that has historically been scarce and costly. From a technical perspective, this approach is now feasible due to breakthroughs in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). While the potential educational benefits are compelling, implementing these technologies also introduces a host of ethical considerations that must be thoughtfully addressed. One of the core advantages of AI systems is their ability to automate routine and mundane tasks, potentially freeing up human educators for more nuanced work. However, the ease of automation risks a “tyranny of the majority”, where the diverse needs of minority or unique learners are overlooked, as they may be harder to systematize and less straightforward to accommodate. Ensuring inclusivity and equity in AI-generated feedback, therefore, becomes a critical aspect of responsible AI implementation in education. The process of developing machine learning models that produce valuable, personalized, and authentic feedback also requires significant input from human domain experts. Decisions around whose expertise is incorporated, how it is captured, and when it is applied have profound implications for the relevance and quality of the resulting feedback. Additionally, the maintenance and continuous refinement of these models are necessary to adapt feedback to evolving contextual, theoretical, and student-related factors. Without ongoing adaptation, feedback risks becoming obsolete or mismatched with the current needs of diverse student populations. Addressing these challenges is essential not only for ethical integrity but also for building the operational trust needed to integrate AI-driven systems as valuable tools in contemporary education. Thoughtful planning and deliberate choices are needed to ensure that these solutions truly benefit all students, allowing AI to support an inclusive and dynamic learning environment.","Lindsay, Euan D; Zhang, Mike; Johri, Aditya; Bjerva, Johannes",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016572,7voyzo7dbn,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Ethics; Automation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Navigation; Machine learning; Turning; Planning; Maintenance; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Lenses; Educational Technology; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Natural Language Processing; Human-Computer Interaction,The Responsible Development of Automated Student Feedback with Generative AI,

"Protecting research integrity is crucial for maintaining trust in the scholarly record. Historically, threats to research integrity stemmed from deliberate human actions, such as data manipulation and misrepresentation. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly prevalent in higher education and is capable of generating research data and scholarly papers almost instantly. The immediate production of research data challenges traditional standards of academic rigor and integrity. The purpose of this study was to explore the role and impact of GAI on research integrity and the scholarly record, emphasizing the need for robust safeguards. For this study, we submitted Likert-type survey questions to GAI, specifically ChatGPT, and investigated how ChatGPT responded to the questions and generated quantitative and mixed-methods data that could be presented as human study participant responses. As GAI evolves, the academic community must address its potential misuse, particularly in research institutions where the pressure to ""publish or perish"" is pervasive. In the age of GAI, ensuring the accuracy and honesty of the scholarly record is imperative for the credibility of innovative and impactful research. Findings indicate that data integrity in higher education research may be at risk if institutions do not establish clear, enforceable guidelines and policies to mitigate the potential misuse of GAI.",Andrea Wilson; Cheryl Burleigh,ERIC,,,t4a246dcwf,,,,Journal of Educational Research and Practice,,,,,True,20250101,,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Computer Software; Technology Integration; Accuracy; Likert Scales; Academic Standards; Difficulty Level; Faculty Publishing; Publish or Perish Issue; Integrity; Higher Education; Research; College Faculty; Questioning Techniques; Ethics; Scholarship,Research Integrity in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence,15
"Despite increasing calls for integrating generative AI (GAI) into education, individual teachers still show disparate attitudes and actions. It is thereby pivotal to understand the reasons behind such divergent responses. However, factors affecting teachers' uptake of GAI in their instruction, particularly their endorsement of students' engagement with such technology in instructed learning, remain under-explored. This study queried this topic by interviewing 17 language teachers teaching at 10 universities across China. Data analyses identified a range of specific factors underlying those teachers' decision to integrate GAI. The study also revealed that the motivating and inhibiting patterns behind teachers' personal engagement with GAI differed from those behind their endorsement of students' GAI use in teaching, suggesting that different dimensions of GAI integration into instruction may be influenced by different sets of factors, and thus may need to be treated separately in practical movement towards GAI integration.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies are gaining traction in higher education, offering potential benefits such as personalized learning support and enhanced productivity. However, successful integration requires understanding the factors influencing students' adoption of these emerging tools. This study investigates the determinants shaping higher education students' adoption of GAI through the lens of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 framework. Data was collected from Pyatigorsk State University students and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings reveal habit (HB) as the most influential predictor of GAI adoption among students, followed by performance expectancy. Hedonic motivation, social influence (SI), and price value positively influenced behavioral intention (BI) to use these technologies. Surprisingly, facilitating conditions (FCs) exhibited a negative effect on BI, suggesting potential gaps in support systems. The study identifies no significant gender differences in the underlying factors driving adoption. Based on the results, recommendations are provided to foster HB formation, communicate benefits, enhance hedonic appeal, leverage SI, address price concerns, and strengthen FCs. Potential limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the data, geographic constraints, reliance on self-reported measures, and the lack of consideration for individual differences as moderators. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on GAI adoption in educational contexts, offering insights to guide higher education institutions in responsibly integrating these innovative tools while addressing student needs and promoting improved learning outcomes.",Olga V.

"Creativity is an imperative skill for today's learners, one that has important contributions to issues of inclusion and equity in education. Therefore, assessing creativity is of major importance in educational contexts. However, scoring creativity based on traditional tools suffers from subjectivity and is heavily time- and labour-consuming. This is indeed the case for the commonly used Alternative Uses Test (AUT), in which participants are asked to list as many different uses as possible for a daily object. The test measures divergent thinking (DT), which involves exploring multiple possible solutions in various semantic domains. This study leverages recent advancements in generative AI (GenAI) to automate the AUT scoring process, potentially increasing efficiency and objectivity. Using two validated models, we analyze the dynamics of creativity dimensions in a multi-step intervention aimed at improving creativity by using repeated AUT sessions (N=157 9th-grade students). Our research questions focus on the behavioural patterns of DT dimensions over time, their correlation with the number of practice opportunities, and the influence of response order on creativity scores. The results show improvement in fluency and flexibility, as a function of practice opportunities, as well as various correlations between DT dimensions. By automating the scoring process, this study aims to provide deeper insights into the development of creative skills over time and explore the capabilities of GenAI in educational assessments.

"Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming higher education. It has already challenged the validity of traditional assessment methods and revealed concerns about the authenticity and reliability of conventional approaches. This opinion piece proposes an expanded theoretical framework for contextual learning, incorporating practical, situational, experiential, interdisciplinary, and ethical dimensions to address the limitations of authentic assessment in the face of GenAI's rapid advancements. Whilst the framework is primarily theoretical and not yet empirically validated, it offers a new way of thinking about assessment design, providing educators with a vocabulary and conceptual tools to create more resilient and effective assessments. Learning Developers, who often lead initiatives, engage in collaborative efforts, and support both educators and students, are particularly well-positioned to implement and advocate for these strategies. By integrating diverse contexts into assessment design, this framework aims to promote higher-order thinking and real-world applications, making assessments more adaptable to the complexities of modern professional environments. Future research should explore the empirical validation of this framework across disciplines to ensure its broader applicability and impact on student engagement, learning outcomes, and academic integrity.",Chahna Gonsalves,ERIC,,,dcxyojunpj,,,34,Journal of Learning Development in Higher Education,,,,,True,20250101,,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Higher Education; Evaluation Methods; Technology Uses in Education; Accuracy; Reliability; Context Effect; Design; Participative Decision Making; Thinking Skills; Authentic Learning; Instructional Design; College Students; College Faculty; Teaching Methods,Contextual Assessment Design in the Age of Generative AI,

"The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is revolutionizing the practice of energy law, offering tools that streamline and slash the costs of regulatory compliance, contract analysis, and litigation preparation. Unlike traditional legal technologies that merely automate existing workflows, GenAI enables practitioners to synthesize vast regulatory data, draft complex documents, and enhance public participation in permitting processes. Regulatory agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), are exploring AI-driven efficiencies in oversight, permitting, and stakeholder engagement. However, the integration of GenAI raises concerns about confidentiality, accuracy, ethical use, and regulatory compliance. Energy practitioners must balance the advantages of AI-driven efficiency with the risks of hallucinations, data security breaches, and lack of explainability in decision-making. Best practices include understanding the capabilities of AI tools, verifying AI-generated legal work, ensuring AI disclosure in regulatory filings, and maintaining professional judgment over AI-assisted outputs. As agencies begin to integrate AI into decision-making, lawyers must advocate for due process protections and transparency in AI-driven decisions. By developing AI competence and implementing ethical safeguards, energy law practitioners can harness the transformative power of GenAI while upholding legal integrity, regulatory fairness, and client trust in an evolving energy landscape. A summary of best practices, based on this article, is provided as Appendix I. The emergence of GenAI marks an inflection point in legal technology that eclipses predecessor innovations. Unlike incremental technology advances that merely automated existing processes, GenAI's capability to produce original human-like content that outperforms lawyers1 or expedites completion of various tasks2 represents a shift that will fundamentally reshape legal practice. These proficiencies coupled with rapid adoption rates unprecedented in the slow-grinding legal profession make GenAI magnitudes more transformative than the introduction of computerized legal research in the 1970s.3 The advancements heralded by GenAI hold particular significance in the energy and utility sectors where complex regulatory frameworks intersect with rapidly evolving market structures and environmental imperatives. GenAI offers unparalleled assistance in navigating the intricacies of energy law, from decoding sector-specific terminology and inside baseball acronyms to synthesizing the tangled web of state and federal regulations, environmental compliance requirements, and dynamic policy landscapes.4 In an era where novel challenges to wholesale markets increasingly strain decision-making processes, GenAI presents opportunities to introduce new efficiencies and expedite resolution pathways. GenAI's potential has not gone unnoticed by the energy sector. The Energy Law Journal previously published two articles that focused specifically on technical applications: one examining utilities' adoption of AI for internal operations and grid management,6 and another exploring AI applications for energy market oversight.7 This article breaks new ground by addressing how GenAI is now expanding beyond these technical use cases into the legal domain of energy practice. Unlike the previous technical focus, we examine how GenAI is transforming law practice, policy-making, and administrative proceedings in the energy sector. Public utility commissioners, administrative law judges, and case intervenors are now leveraging AI to enhance regulatory oversight and improve scrutiny of utility proposals and underlying data.8 Further ahead, GenAI holds the promise of democratizing access to legal expertise for traditionally marginalized participants -- smaller utilities, emerging market entrants, and environmental justice communities -- who have historically been excluded by the prohibitive costs of participation in regional transmission organization stakeholder processes and regulatory proceedings. While acknowledging GenAI's benefits in reducing legal service costs and improving decision-making efficiency, this article also addresses the ethical considerations, potential misuse, and regulatory hurdles that the prior technically-focused articles did not cover. By understanding both the capabilities and limitations of GenAI in legal contexts, energy practitioners can harness this technology responsibly to benefit clients and the broader energy ecosystem.","Elefant, Carolyn",Business Source Ultimate,,,xy4b6xp4hr,,,2,Energy Law Journal,,165,119,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=xy4b6xp4hr&recordId=xy4b6xp4hr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Foundation for the Energy Law Journal,Stakeholder analysis; United States.

"This paper introduces an innovative paradigm in interactive wireless networking, leveraging large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to dynamically align network configurations and transmission strategies with user intents. Central to this paradigm is a “human-in-the-loop” framework that incorporates two pivotal processes: intent alignment with the network and streamlined user interaction. Existing quality of experience (QoE) modeling methodologies often suffer from a weak correlation between user intent and network adjustments. To address this, we review intent consistency in QoE modeling, utilizing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and advanced prompt engineering to seamlessly integrate human intent into network configurations. Surrounding our paradigm, we provide a comprehensive survey on a multi-layered integration that spans the application, intent, semantic, network, and transmission layers, seamlessly translating user intent into optimized networking and communication outcomes. We investigate key technologies such as semantic communication and GenAI-enabled transmission and networking for pioneering applications, which allow for the real-time understanding and execution of high-layer intents, enabling the integration of user intents with wireless networks. Additionally, we explore cloud-edge-device collaboration within our paradigm, which distributes computational and semantic tasks across the network infrastructure to enable low-latency, scalable, and intelligent interactions. The paper concludes with an analysis of existing challenges and prospective research directions, highlighting the transformative potential of GenAI in shaping the future of intent-driven wireless networks.","Qin, X.; Sun, M.; Dai, J.; Ma, P.; Cao, Y.; Zhang, J.; Wang, J.; Xu, X.; Zhang, P.; Niyato, D.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2025.3567613,tbvma4l5q5,,,4,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"The booming usage of Electric Vehicles (EV) led to the augmentation of Lithium-Ion batteries. This is due to its charging speed, ease of maintenance, lower operational cost, and high specific energy. Yet, these batteries are under scrutiny due to the significant amount of fire accidents in recent years. These accidents result from thermal runaway, a chain reaction that may lead to a catastrophic explosion. Approximately 60% of EV battery fire incidents stem from internal thermal runaway while charging accidents account for 30%. This paper envisages an ensemble machine learning (ML) approach for early prediction of fire in Li-ion batteries by quantitatively analyzing the volume of gases released during venting. The methodology is based upon previous research conducted and employs a dataset curated from previous studies to serve as a benchmark. Generative AI (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) is used to generate synthetic data samples. The validity of the dataset has been rigorously verified using Kernal Density plots, ensuring its reliability for predictive modeling. The random forest algorithm proves its efficacy and can predict the time before the thermal runaway to alert the user. Performance evaluation metrics, including 97.83% accuracy, 96.97% precision, 98.63% recall, and a 97.8% F1 score, highlight its robustness.

"Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication supports numerous tasks, from driving safety to entertainment services. To achieve a holistic view, vehicles are typically equipped with multiple sensors. However, processing large volumes of multimodal data increases transmission load, while the dynamic nature of vehicular networks adds to transmission instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-enhanced multimodal semantic communication (SemCom), referred to as G-MSC , designed to handle various vehicular network tasks by employing suitable analog or digital transmission. GAI presents a promising opportunity to transform the SemCom framework by significantly enhancing semantic encoding, semantic information transmission, and semantic decoding. It optimizes multimodal information fusion at the transmitter, enhances channel robustness during transmission, and mitigates noise interference at the receiver. To validate the effectiveness of the G-MSC framework, we conduct a case study showcasing its performance in vehicular communication networks for predictive tasks.

"AI technologies have become increasingly adopted in wireless communications. As an emerging type of AI technologies, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is gaining attention in communication security. Due to its powerful learning ability, GAI models have demonstrated superiority over conventional AI methods. However, GAI still has several limitations, including high computational complexity and limited adaptability. Mixture of experts (MoE) technology, which uses multiple expert models for prediction through a gate mechanism, proposes possible solutions. In this article, we first review GAI model applications in physical layer communication security, discuss limitations, and explore how MoE can help GAI overcome these limitations. Furthermore, we propose an MoE-enabled GAI framework for network optimization problems for communication security. To demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, we provide a case study in a cooperative-friendly jamming scenario. The experimental results show that the MoE-enabled framework effectively assists the GAI algorithm, solves its limitations, and enhances communication security.","Zhao, Changyuan; Du, Hongyang; Niyato, Dusit; Kang, Jiawen; Xiong, Zehui; Kim, Dong In; Shen, Xuemin; Letaief, Khaled B.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MWC.001.2400150,pxesydjc4v,,,3,"IEEE Wireless Communications, Wireless Communications, IEEE, IEEE Wireless Commun.",,184,176,,True,20250601,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Wireless communication; Adaptation models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Physical layer; Safety; Security; Jamming; Optimization",Enhancing Physical Layer Communication Security Through Generative AI with Mixture of Experts,32
"The emergence of Generative AI technologies, represented by ChatGPT, has triggered extensive discussions among scholars in the education sector. While relevant research continues to grow, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding that systematically measures the effects of Generative AI on student learning outcomes. This study employs meta-analysis to integrate findings from previous experimental and quasiexperimental research to evaluate the impact of Generative AI on student learning outcomes. The analysis of 44 effect sizes from 21 independent studies indicates that Generative AI tools, compared to traditional AI tools or no intervention, moderately enhance student learning outcomes (g = 0.572). These tools significantly improve the cognitive (g = 0.604), behavioral (g = 0.698), and affective (g = 0.478) dimensions of learning outcomes. In addition, the study identifies and examines 6 potential moderating variables: educational level, sample size, subject area, teaching model, intervention duration, and assessment instrument. The results of the moderating effects test reveal that sample size and assessment instrument significantly influence the effectiveness of Generative AI. For sample size, the effect of Generative AI on small samples (g = 1.216) is greater than that on medium (g = 0.476) and large samples (g = 0.547). For assessment instrument, the effect of Generative AI on self-developed tests (g = 0.984) is greater than that on standardized tests (g = 0.557). The meta-analysis result indicated that the use of Generative AI should be supplemented with detailed guidance and flexible strategies.

"Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the number of services providing generative AI has been steadily increasing. As different services enter the market, the generative AI interfaces users experience become more diverse. However, none of the services has yet established itself as the dominant tool, and which interface component affects user preferences the most has yet to be identified. This study investigates user preferences based on the interface of generative AI services currently on the market. We investigated users' preferred interface components by setting the output data type, generative style, output variation, reference style, and generation history provided by the current generative AI service as properties. We collected data from 500 users through a survey and conducted conjoint analysis. Users preferred the provision of 10 generation histories the most, and the second most preferred the provision of reference style in footnote format. In addition, it was found that there was no preference for the creative generative style, which can be interpreted as users being aware of the problem of hallucination in generative AI. The results of this study will help future generative AI services design interfaces that consider user experience.","Yeon, Jesun; Jung, Youchan; Baek, Yongki; Lee, Daeho; Shin, Jungwoo; Chung, Won Young",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1080/10447318.2024.2400379,cikuoikbnj,,,12,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,,7637,7626,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=cikuoikbnj&recordId=cikuoikbnj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250615,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Logistic regression analysis; User interfaces; Hallucinations (<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Conjoint analysis,User Preferences on a Generative AI User Interface Through a Choice Experiment.,41

"Background/Objectives: In clinical informatics, the term 'information overload' is increasingly used to describe the operational impediments of excessive documentation. While electronic health records (EHRs) are growing in abundance, many medical records (MRs) remain in legacy formats that impede efficient, systematic processing, contributing to the extenuating challenges of care fragmentation. Thus, there is a growing interest in using generative AI (genAI) for automated MR summarization and characterization. Methods: MRs for a set of 78 individuals were digitized. Some were known systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cases, while others were under evaluation for possible SLE classification. A two-pass genAI assessment strategy was implemented using the Claude 3.5 large language model (LLM) to mine MRs for information relevant to classifying SLE vs. undifferentiated connective tissue disorder (UCTD) vs. neither via the 22-criteria EULAR 2019 model. Results: Compared to clinical determination, the antinuclear antibody (ANA) criterion (whose results are crucial for classifying SLE-negative cases) exhibited favorable sensitivity 0.78 ± 0.09 (95% confidence interval) and a positive predictive value 0.85 ± 0.08 but a marginal performance for specificity 0.60 ± 0.11 and uncertain predictivity for the negative predictive value 0.48 ± 0.11. Averaged over the remaining 21 criteria, these four performance metrics were 0.69 ± 0.11, 0.87 ± 0.04, 0.54 ± 0.10, and 0.93 ± 0.03. Conclusions: ANA performance statistics imply that genAI yields confident assessments of SLE negativity (per high sensitivity) but weaker positivity. The remaining genAI criterial determinations support (per specificity) confident assertions of SLE-positivity but tend to misclassify a significant fraction of clinical positives as UCTD.","Lushington, Gerald H.; Nair, Sandeep; Jupe, Eldon R.; Rubin, Bernard; Purushothaman, Mohan",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/diagnostics15182409,apwbbldmy5,,,18,Diagnostics (2075-4418),,,2409,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=apwbbldmy5&recordId=apwbbldmy5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250915,MDPI,Systemic lupus erythematosus; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Medical records; Autoimmune diseases; Medical informatics; Automatic summarization,Criteria and Protocol: Assessing Generative AI Efficacy in Perceiving EULAR 2019 Lupus Classification.,15

"GenAI has revolutionized higher education across the globe. One group that is particularly impacted is international students. We examined the factors influencing international students' intentions to use GenAI. We recruited participants studying in the U.S. through an online survey. Our results suggest that attitudes toward GenAI use, PEU, PU, enjoyment, subjective norms, novelty, trust in technology, perceived value, and AI literacy are positively associated with the intention to use GenAI. Fear of plagiarism had a negative relationship with the intention to use GenAI. Trust in technology, PEU, fear of plagiarism, PU, and AI literacy indirectly influence GenAI usage intention via attitude and perceived value, underscoring both the appeal and concerns of GenAI in learning.

"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) not only has the potential to aid L2 academic writing but also poses unique challenges concerning impacts and ethics. Reflection journals, which promote critical thinking and metacognitive awareness, have the capacity to guide GenAI-assisted writing, yet remain underexplored. This study examines and compares the effects of structured reflection journals (SRJs) and semi-structured reflection journals (SSRJs) on enhancing postgraduates' GenAI literacy within an L2 academic writing context. Based on the frameworks proposed by UNESCO and Digital Promise, the study developed a GenAI literacy framework that includes four dimensions: (a) ""Operational Competence in GenAI Tools,"" (b) ""Ethics and Security in GenAI Usage,"" (c) ""Critical Evaluation of GenAI Outputs and Autonomy"" and (d) ""Reflection in GenAI Application."" The study assessed the GenAI literacy levels of 39 participants before and after four GenAI-assisted writing tasks. Reflection journals were completed after each task (20 in the SRJ group and 19 in the SSRJ group). Results revealed significant improvements in GenAI literacy across three dimensions (Dimensions 1 to 3), with no significant difference between the SRJ and SSRJ groups. However, thematic analysis of reflective content showed that SRJs, with their more comprehensive guiding questions, encouraged deeper engagement with GenAI-related rules and more thorough evaluations of GenAI-generated content compared to SSRJs.

"Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is an important skill enabling students to co-construct knowledge and tackle complex problems through group interactions. While the importance of group interactions in CPS is well recognized, it is unclear how the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), with advanced cognitive support, may alter group dynamics in CPS. This study bridges this gap by examining group interactions in GAI-supported CPS, focusing on the structural patterns and interaction content characterizing students' social dynamics. Six groups of three to five students used an online messaging tool with a GPT-4.0 enabled chatbot for a CPS activity. Group interactions were modelled using network analysis and interaction content was coded into socio-emotional, cognitive, metacognitive, and coordinative dimensions. Employing a network assortativity measure and a binomial test to the interactions among students and the GAI chatbot, we identified a GAI-centred interaction pattern in which students tended to interact significantly more with the chatbot than their peers in the collaborative problem-solving process. Students' interactions with the chatbot involved primarily cognitive interactions but also metacognitive and socio-emotional interactions. This study introduces novel network methods to analyse small group interactions and contributes new empirical evidence and theoretical insights into the social influence of GAI tools, emphasizing the need for further investigations on the factors influencing interaction dynamics among students and GAI tools in collaborative learning.",Shihui Feng,ERIC,,10.1111/bjet.13611,rp54ds7vmn,,,5,British Journal of Educational Technology,,2145,2125,,True,20250901,,Group Dynamics; Interaction; Problem Solving; Cooperative Learning; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Network Analysis; Computer Mediated Communication; Peer Relationship; Metacognition; Social Influences,Group Interaction Patterns in Generative AI-Supported Collaborative Problem Solving: Network Analysis of the Interactions among Students and a GAI Chatbot,56
"The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has brought opportunities and new challenges to higher education. Students need a high level of self-regulated learning to adapt to this change. However, it is difficult for students to persist in self-regulation without guidance. Metacognitive support has a significant advantage in enhancing self-regulated learning, but fewer studies have explored the effects of its role in GenAI environments. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impacts of metacognitive support on college students' self-regulated learning and learning experiences in a GenAI environment. A quasi-experiment was designed in which 68 college students were divided into two groups. The experimental group (N = 35) received explicit metacognitive support, while the control group (N = 33) did not receive any metacognitive prompts. The experiment lasted 4 weeks. The study measured students' academic performance, self-regulated learning ability and learning experiences (including cognitive load and technology acceptance). The results indicate that in the GenAI environment, metacognitive support, while not producing significant between-group differences in achievement, enhances students' self-regulated learning abilities particularly in terms of task strategy and self-evaluation, as well as optimizing their learning experience. The study also found that students were at risk of decreasing their level of self-regulated learning if they lacked metacognitive support in the GenAI environment. The conclusion points out that GenAI supports learners to accomplish learning tasks while potentially reducing self-regulated learning effectiveness, and that metacognitive support is key to supporting effective regulation in learners' GenAI environments. This study provides an important theoretical and practical basis for how to better support learners' learning in GenAI environments.",Xiaoqing Xu; Lifang Qiao; Nuo Cheng; Hongxia Liu; Wei Zhao,ERIC,,10.1111/bjet.13599,ivg656yfsv,,,5,British Journal of Educational Technology,,1863,1842,,True,20250901,,Independent Study; Learning Experience; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Technology Uses in Education; Metacognition; College Students; Difficulty Level,Enhancing Self-Regulated Learning and Learning Experience in Generative AI Environments: The Critical Role of Metacognitive Support,56
"The overburdened lecturers today face the dual challenge of monitoring online attendance and ensuring active student engagement, while also receiving instant feedback on concept comprehension during live lectures. They are further pressed to extend practical problem-solving experiences beyond the classroom and deliver higher-order thinking assessments - all without increasing their workload.

"Fixed network infrastructure is often insufficient in addressing dynamic communication demands, particularly in densely populated urban areas. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), specifically UAV-based stations (UAV-BS), offer a flexible and adaptive solution by acting as mobile base stations to alleviate data traffic congestion. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages generative artificial intelligence (GAI) to optimize the placement of UAV-BS in urban environments. The proposed system integrates GAI agents with LlamaIndex and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques powered by large language models (LLMs) to enhance decision-making. LlamaIndex serves as an intermediary between user queries and a curated database of UAV-related research, enabling the framework to retrieve and utilize semantically relevant information through RAG.

"Astract-Recent advances in foundation models are significantly expanding the capabilities of AI models. As part of this progress, this paper introduces a robot design framework that uses a diffusion model approach for generating 3D mesh structures. Specifically, we focus on generating directly fabri-cable robot structures that require no post-processing guided by human-imposed design constraints. Our approach can find the optimal design of the robot by optimizing or composing embedding vectors of the model. The efficacy of the framework is validated through an application to design, fabricate, and evaluate a jumping robot. Our solution is an optimized jumping robot with a 41% increase in jump height compared to the state-of-the-art design. Additionally, when the robot is augmented with an optimized foot, it can land reliably with a success ratio of 88% in contrast to the 4% success ratio of the base robot.","Kim, Byungchul; Wang, Tsun-Hsuan; Rus, Daniela",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICRA55743.2025.11128113,3p3jcgtk6j,,,,"2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025 IEEE International Conference on",,6274,6267,,True,20250519,IEEE,Robotics and Control Systems; Three-dimensional displays; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Foundation models; Diffusion models; Vectors; Reliability; Robots; Design optimization; Computational Design; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Design Optimization; Jumping Robot,Generative-AI-Driven Jumping Robot Design Using Diffusion Models,
"At present, badminton tactical training has problems such as single confrontation scenario and insufficient dynamic strategy generation. Traditional simulation methods rely too much on coaching experience and fixed playback videos, which is difficult to meet the needs of athletes’ personalized tactical awareness training and adaptive training in complex confrontation environments. In response to the above problems, this study proposes a tactical simulation and scenario training system based on generative AI. First, this paper constructs a multidimensional tactical knowledge graph and establishes a tactical ontology model including spatial trajectory, hitting mode, and confrontation strategy; secondly, a dynamic confrontation scenario generation module based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is developed. Finally, a tactical optimization engine driven by the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is designed to dynamically adjust the difficulty coefficient and strategy complexity of the generated scenarios. In the experiment, the athletes in the experimental group using the system achieved an accuracy rate of 85.4% in tactical prediction, which is significantly higher than the 75.1% of the control group; in terms of multi-shot connection error rate, the experimental group is 12.0 %,while the control group is17.2 %. These results show that this system can provide a personalized and diversified training environment and significantly improve athletes’ tactical awareness and technical connection ability.","Ma, Jiming; Hao, Long; Qian, Kun; Long, Jiashun; Li, Li; Zhong, Yanling",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ISCTIS65944.2025.11065641,4ata6lffvv,,,,"2025 5th International Symposium on Computer Technology and Information Science (ISCTIS), Computer Technology and Information Science (ISCTIS), 2025 5th International Symposium on",,256,250,,True,20250516,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Heuristic algorithms; Knowledge graphs; Prediction algorithms; Trajectory; Scenario generation; Optimization; Videos; Intelligent Training System; Badminton Tactical Simulation; CGAN Algorithm; Tactical Prediction and Multi-shot Connection",Development of Badminton Tactical Simulation and Scenario Training System Based on Generative AI,

"In the era of digital transformation, data analysis plays a significant role in data science and machine learning, it act as a decision support system. Extracting insights from data is really difficult and effort-intensive activity. The Automated data Analyser is developed for such users who need automated data insights and machine learning model recommendations. It is built using python framework streamlit and uses google Gemini for generating the insights and suggesting machine learning algorithms for the given dataset. Initially the dataset is given as the only input nothing other input is needed as the system is automated it automatically pre-processes the data and generates the insightful data visualizations along with the descriptions. If the dataset is huge and contains more rows then the system uses dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the size of data and preserve the insights. By reducing the size of dataset using dimensionality reduction techniques it takes less time to analyse the dataset. It is an efficient system for huge data sets. The system is also capable to show the mathematical analysis of data to analyse the spread of data. To produce the data insights by Gemini LLM a small set of data along with prompt is given to LLM to generate the insights and recommendations. The application uses SQLite database to store the visualizations and insights. Finally the report is generated which includes the data insights, data visualizations and machine learning model suggestions.

"Design is critical in creating impactful systems, especially in domains like IoT applications where user needs are complex and dynamic. Traditional design thinking methods focus on empathy and creativity, essential for designing adaptive systems. However, capturing nuanced user requirements and generating creative solutions can be costly and time-consuming. This work explores the role of AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models, in enhancing design thinking by generating inclusive user needs and creating innovative design solutions. We present a method for leveraging LLMs to understand and interpret user requirements, which then inform generative design processes through a diffusion model. We demonstrate this approach through case studies of adaptive assistive devices, showing how this AI-driven design process enhances both creativity and empathy. Our results show significant improvements in both design quality (PDS scores: 4.75 vs 2.75) and creativity (CPSS scores: 4.0 vs 1.75), suggesting that emulating the design thinking process when generating solutions with AI enables smarter and more empathetic design solutions.","Zhang, Zhufei; Du, Xiao; Su, Wensheng; Camburn, Bradley",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/LCIoT64881.2025.11118557,v7cboljwif,,,,"2025 IEEE Latin Conference on IoT (LCIoT), IoT (LCIoT), 2025 IEEE Latin Conference on",,21,18,,True,20250423,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Adaptive systems; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Design methodology; Emulation; Diffusion models; Internet of Things; Assistive devices; Creativity; Empathic Design; Large Language models",Digital Designer: Emulation of Empathy-Driven Design with Generative AI,
"The advancements in diffusion model enables the creation of highly detailed images. However, concurrently fusing texts and images poses significant challenges, often struggling with the maintenance of text accuracy across languages, optimal placement, and appropriate typography. To address these challenges, we introduce the Multilingual Accurate Textual Image Customization (MATIC) framework. MATIC employs the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) concept to decompose the textual image generation process into multiple steps, leveraging diverse generative artificial intelligence, including Multimodal Large Language Model (MMLLM) and diffusion model. The framework first generates the desired text and a corresponding prompt for the diffusion model based on user input. The diffusiongenerated image is then examined to remove any undesired text. Meanwhile, the typographic elements are designed to align with the visual content. Finally, the textual image is fused with the aid of a grid coordinate system, evaluated by MMLLM, and further customized by the user through natural language. Experimental results demonstrate that MATIC can produce accurate, high-quality, multilingual textual images that meet user requirements across various domains, including digital marketing, graphic design, and educational content creation.","Wu, Chiao-Hsin; Lai, I-Wei",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/PacificVis64226.2025.00042,ehinphomfr,,,,"2025 IEEE 18th Pacific Visualization Conference (PacificVis), Pacific Visualization Conference (PacificVis), 2025 IEEE 18th, PACIFICVIS",,357,352,,True,20250422,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Visualization; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Semantics; Media; Diffusion models; Natural language processing; Multilingual; Maintenance; Optimization; Computing methodologies; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Computer Vision,MATIC: Multilingual Accurate Textual Image Customization via Joint Generative Artificial Intelligence,
"Developing problem-solving competency is central to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, yet translating this priority into effective approaches to problem-solving instruction and assessment has been a significant challenge. The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT in higher education introduces new considerations: how to define problem-solving competency in a genAI era, and how these tools can help or hinder students' development of STEM problem-solving competency. Our research takes steps in examining these considerations by studying how and why college students are currently using genAI tools in their STEM coursework, with a specific focus on how they employ these tools to support their problem-solving. We conducted an online survey of 40 STEM college students from diverse institutions across the US. In addition, we surveyed 28 STEM faculty to understand instructor views on effective and ineffective genAI tool use in STEM courses and their guidance for students. Our findings reveal high adoption rates and diverse applications of genAI tools among STEM students. The most common use cases of genAI tools in STEM coursework include finding explanations, exploring related topics, summarizing readings, and helping with problem-set questions. The primary motivation for using genAI tools in STEM coursework was to save time. Moreover, we found that over half of the student participants reported simply inputting a problem for AI to generate solutions, potentially bypassing their own problem-solving processes. These findings indicate that despite high adoption rates, students' current approaches to utilizing genAI tools often fall short in enhancing their own STEM problem-solving competencies. The study also explored students' and STEM instructors' perceptions of the benefits and risks associated with using genAI tools in STEM education. Our findings provide insights into how to guide students on appropriate genAI use in STEM courses and how to design genAI-based tools to foster students' problem-solving competency.","Wang, Karen D.; Wu, Zhangyang; Tufts, L'Nard; Wieman, Carl; Salehi, Shima; Haber, Nick",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016406,rrj2gptvz5,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,10,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Surveys; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Educational technology; Chatbots; Problem-solving; Engineering education; STEM; Educational Technology,Scaffold or Crutch?

This study considers these effects, focusing on the impacts of genAI on the intrinsic value of learning and its influences on shaping transformative encounters with knowledge in STEM curricula. The implications of incorporating genAI into outcomes and assessment tasks are examined using a constructivist approach based on taxonomies of cognitive skills involved in learning and STEM competency development namely, Bloom's and SOLO taxonomies, and Luckett's knowledge planes.

"This paper aims to find out how Generative AI models like GPT-3, when integrated with traditional teaching methods can enhance academic performance as well as the emotional well-being of students. Most of the digital education systems and tools only focus on curriculum delivery and fail to address the emotional states of students and their individual learning capabilities, this leads to the downfall of their academic progress and will yield poor learning outcomes. To address this issue, we have developed a system that analyzes the emotional states of students and then further categorizes them according to their learning pace (fast, medium, or slow). Our system works by first analyzing the survey responses collected from students using a scoring system that is predefined. Then it generates a personalized lesson plan tailored for each student according to the insights gained from the responses. With the integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 for the Lesson plan generation we ensure the content generated will be tailored specifically for each student's needs.

"Generative AI (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and content creation. However, their significant computational demands during inference often require cloud servers, which are currently the only viable option for handling complex multi-modal models like GPT-4. The inherent complexity of these models increases latency, posing challenges even within cloud environments. Furthermore, cloud reliance brings other challenges, including high bandwidth consumption to transfer diverse data types. Worse, in personalized GAI applications like virtual assistants, similar prompts frequently occur, causing redundant transmission and computation of replies, which further increases overhead. Accelerating the inference of multi-modal systems is, therefore, critical in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we aim to improve the inference efficiency through prompt caching; if a current prompt is semantically similar to a previous one, the system can reuse the earlier response without invoking the model again. We leverage collaborative edge computing to cache popular replies and store their request embeddings. New prompts are locally processed to extract embeddings, with their qualities determined by the resources available on edge servers. Our problem is formulated as an optimization to manage offloading decisions for GAI tasks, aiming to avoid cloud inferences and minimize latency while maximizing reply quality. Given its non-convex nature, we propose to solve it via Block Successive Upper Bound Minimization (BSUM). Reinforcement learning is employed to actively pre-cache prompts, tackling the complexity of unknown prompt popularity.

"Contemporary learners routinely acquire knowledge asynchronously from sources outside of formal learning settings, thus increasing the demand for instructional technologies to address the learners’ various knowledge gaps within STEM fields. Whereas post-assessment remediation is a high payoff target for such interventions, we investigate invoking Generative AI (GenAI) to ‘prime the pump’ for learners with any needed terminology, concepts, and technical-leveling prior to conventional human-delivered remediation. We have developed the GenAIprime framework that invokes GenAI Large Language Models (LLMs) to create personalized, multimedia-based remedial materials by prompting GenAI with the specific incorrect responses to each student’s digitized quiz/exam submission. By integrating with the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS), GenAIprime analyzes assessment content and extracts context using the OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo model.

"In the era of artificial intelligence, fostering creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills has become increasingly important, particularly in mathematics education. Problem-posing pedagogy is recognized as an effective approach to achieving these educational goals. However, teachers often face challenges in task design, creating effective prompts, and managing classroom interactions. This study proposes a novel theoretical framework powered by Generative AI (GAI) to address these challenges. The framework consists of four interconnected stages: Design, Simulate, Engage, and Refine. By leveraging GAI, teachers can generate personalized tasks, anticipate classroom dynamics, and dynamically adjust teaching strategies. A case study demonstrates the framework's potential to enhance student engagement and improve problem-posing activities. Despite its promising potential, the framework requires further empirical validation and optimization through real-world application. Future research will explore the integration pathways of GAI in mathematical problem-posing pedagogy.","Shao, Huijun; Tang, Gaohua",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICEIT64364.2025.10975950,oxuqzcfeqz,,,,"2025 14th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology (ICEIT), Educational and Information Technology (ICEIT), 2025 14th International Conference on",,115,111,,True,20250314,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; Training; Technological innovation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Face recognition; Problem-solving; Iterative methods; Information technology; Optimization; Creativity; Guidelines; Mathematical Problem-Posing; Theoretical Framework; Case Study,Empowering Mathematical Problem-Posing Pedagogy with Generative AI: A Theoretical Framework and Case Study,
"Stress management and relaxation are critical areas of interest in mental health and well-being. Forest bathing is a practice that has been shown to have a positive effect on reducing stress by stimulating all the senses in an immersive nature experience. Since access to nature is not universally available to everyone, virtual reality has emerged as a promising tool to simulate this type of experience. Furthermore, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools offer new opportunities to create highly personalized and immersive experiences that can enhance relaxation and reduce stress. This study explores the potential of personalized multisensory VR environments, designed using GenAI tools, to optimize relaxation and stress relief via two experiments that are currently underway. The first evaluates the effectiveness of non-personalized versus personalized VR scenes generated using AI tools to promote increased relaxation. The second explores the potential benefits of providing the user with additional personalization tools, from adding new virtual elements to the AI-generated scene, to adding AI-generated sounds and scent/haptics customization. Ultimately, this research aims to identify which customizable elements may lead to improved therapeutic benefits for multisensory VR experiences.","Lopes, Marilia K.

"Web scraping is a method of extracting information from websites, and it plays a crucial role in data collection for various applications such as market research, academic studies, and competitive analysis. Traditional web scraping can be challenging, especially when dealing with multiple websites that may have different structures and content formats. The complexity of writing and maintaining scrap scripts for each site adds to the difficulty. To address these challenges, Generative AI (GenAI) offers a powerful solution for web scraping. This paper explores the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model architecture and ScrapeGraphAI, a Python library that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), RAG and graph logic to automate the creation of scraping pipelines. ScrapeGraphAI employs LLMs to understand the desired information and build the necessary scraping logic. It supports multi-format data extraction, handles both single-page and multi-page scenarios, and generates scraping pipelines based on user instructions, significantly reducing manual coding efforts. The Gemini LLM is introduced as an alternative tool for web scraping. This study compares the performance of RAG, ScrapeGraphAI and Gemini LLM in collecting data from various websites to gather information on upcoming academic events. The comparison focuses on the efficiency, accuracy, and ease of use of both methods. Through this analysis, we aim to highlight the advantages and limitations of using AI driven web scraping technologies in streamlining data collection processes.","Pushpalatha, M.; Aravindan, Madhu Shree",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/RAIT65068.2025.11088928,twanjr3y6n,,,,"2025 6th International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT), Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT), 2025 6th International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250306,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Photonics and Electrooptics; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Analytical models; Accuracy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Retrieval augmented generation; Pipelines; Data collection; Libraries; Data models; Data mining; Logic; Web scraping; Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG); ScrapeGraphAI; Gemini; LLMs",Comparative Analysis of Web Scraping Methodologies Using Generative AI,

"Retinal imaging, like fundus photographs, is generally used to analyze eye conditions, where professionals like ophthalmologists review the images to identify signs of nerve damage or leakage, helping determine the severity of the disease. However, manual evaluation of such images can lead to errors due to human factors like fatigue and work stress. With advancements in technology, especially in artificial intelligence (AI), it is possible to reduce human-driven errors. AI-based solutions allow professionals to re-evaluate their analyses and facilitate early and accurate predictions. Computer vision-based AI can detect minute signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) that humans may miss, thereby improving overall accuracy and guiding the treatment in the right direction. Extensive research has been conducted, and various AI-based solutions have been developed to detect DR using various retinal imaging modalities. Since obtaining data from unhealthy individuals is challenging and expensive, an anomaly detection approach using healthy fundus images has been explored. To address these challenges, proposing a novel solution ViT-MAD (Vision Transformer Masked Anomaly Detector), a Vision Transformer-based method that leverages a similarity score model to accurately detect diabetic retinopathy in fundus images.

"May be the main challenge of using AI in education is ensuring that its use does not compromise the originality or credibility of the research. In addition, there is a risk that excessive use of AI could lead to ethical issues, such as plagiarism, obvious inaccuracies, or a general dilution of the intellectual contribution. In an effort to mitigate these risks, institutions should provide additional guidelines on the ethical use of AI and promote best practices among researchers.AI has the potential to enrich academic research by increasing productivity, improving communication, and in some ways making research more available. The key element will be the ethical responsibility by the scientists and researchers in the use of AI as a helper more than a science producer.

"Purpose: The aims of this research paper are bifold firstly, it attempts to identify the contributions of the RQE theory and secondly, to enable corporates to evade the Red Queen Effect by using generative artificial intelligence to be prepared for Industry 5.0. Design/Methodology/Approach: The red queen effect is a metaphor used in the business world to describe the unsuccessful efforts of a company to get ahead of its competition. The red queen effect is the need to continually adapt and evolve to maintain relevance in an ever-changing environment. Companies must constantly innovate and find new ways to stay ahead of the competition to ensure their survival and success. Companies typically research or study the competition and then implement strategies to help boost their company sales and profits. This is an effective and practical method of outmaneuvering the competition. Findings: The use of SD enables GAI to expand CP beyond short-term adjustments and actions, empowering businesses to foresee and create content that takes into account projected future customer preferences and behaviours which seeks to solve the requirement of so-called sustainable consumption patterns by providing the answer in the form of customers mass customization which can be used by the companies to avoid red queen effect currently prevailing in their respective industries thus getting ahead in race of competition and preparing them for future industry 5.0. Practical Implications: While this technique works in theory, companies might not achieve their goals because the competition engages in the same business practice. Despite a company's efforts to surpass the competition, the company does not move forward or grow. Originality/Value: The research is only of its kind solution to Red queen effect faced by companies in current Industry 4.0.","Kumar, Saurav",Business Source Ultimate,,10.35808/ijfirm/423,u4oxwa2rhf,,,2,"International Journal of Finance, Insurance &amp; Risk Management",,53,40,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=u4oxwa2rhf&recordId=u4oxwa2rhf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250401,International Strategic Management Association,Industry 4.0; Technological innovations; Sustainable consumption; Mass customization; Business planning; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Competition (Psychology),The Red Queen Effect (RQE) on Business and the Role of Generative AI in Industry 5.0.,15

There are varying perceptions of the usefulness of GAI, as well as a breadth of differing policies and procedures currently in place for the use of GAI in classroom settings. This article examines several key areas within the expanding scope of GAI literature, including the use of GAI broadly within higher education and business education in particular, its efficacy for student learning, how it can be used for assessment and how it can be assessed, challenges in detecting its usage in assignments, and the breadth of policies created for regulating its use.","Lundbohm, Rachel; Hagen, Marcia; Fashant, Crystal Saric; Evan, Rebecca; Bergman, Courtney; Al-Fattal, Anas",Business Source Ultimate,,,vlrl2rny45,,,1,Journal of Managerial Issues,,41,28,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=vlrl2rny45&recordId=vlrl2rny45&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250301,Journal of Managerial Issues / PSU,"Business education; Government regulation; Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Business and Secretarial Schools; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Students; Knowledge transfer; Higher education; Ethical problems; Educational technology",Navigating Generative Artificial Intelligence in the Business and Management Classroom.,37
"Understanding learners' preferences in educational settings is crucial for optimizing learning outcomes and experience. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into educational contexts, it is crucial to understand learners' preferences between AI and human tutors to support their learning. While AI demonstrates growing potential in education, the phenomenon of algorithm aversion, which is a tendency to favour human decision making over algorithmic solutions, requires further investigation. To explore this issue, an experiment involving 114 university students was conducted to measure learners' preferences for different feedback sources before and after exposure to one of four conditions: no feedback, human tutor feedback, ChatGPT feedback through a free-dialogue user interface, and AI-powered writing analytics tool feedback through a structured interface. Our results revealed a strong initial preference for human tutors. However, the post-task analysis showed an important nuance. While the general preference for human tutors persisted, learners' preference towards the free-dialogue interface (ChatGPT 4.0) of ChatGPT increased, whereas the structured AI interface (AI-powered writing analytics tool) reinforced the preference for human tutors. These findings offer theoretical and practical contributions by extending algorithm aversion theory to educational contexts and demonstrating that appropriate interaction design can mitigate this aversion. The success of free-dialogue interfaces suggests that overcoming algorithm aversion may depend more on creating natural, flexible interaction experiences than purely technical optimization. However, we must also consider that increased preference for AI tools, particularly those with more engaging interfaces, may potentially lead to over-reliance and metacognitive laziness among learners, highlighting the importance of balancing technological support with the development of independent learning skills.",Huixiao Le; Yuan Shen; Zijian Li; Mengyu Xia; Luzhen Tang; Xinyu Li; Jiyou Jia; Qiong Wang; Dragan Gaševic; Yizhou Fan,ERIC,,10.1111/bjet.13614,ion3tgn7yf,,,5,British Journal of Educational Technology,,1783,1758,,True,20250901,,Student Attitudes; Preferences; Electronic Learning; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Technology Uses in Education; Tutors; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Technology Integration; Algorithms; College Students; Feedback (Response); Writing Evaluation; Man Machine Systems; Resistance (Psychology),Breaking Human Dominance: Investigating Learners' Preferences for Learning Feedback from Generative AI and Human Tutors,56

Then, we discuss the key advantages of the DM-driven communication paradigms. To elaborate further, we explore DM-driven channel generation mechanisms for channel estimation, extrapolation, and feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We showcase the numerical performance of conditional DM using the accurate DeepMIMO channel datasets, revealing its superiority in generating high-fidelity channels and mitigating unforeseen distribution shifts in sophisticated scenes. Furthermore, several DM-driven communication management designs promising to deal with imperfect channels and task-oriented communications are conceived.

"The Internet of Things (IoT) has been expediting unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network autonomy for 5G and beyond applications. In this context, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is widely applied to improve service efficiency. It can provide customized service decisions for diverse UAV requirements through deep learning. However, existing GAI solutions may fail to generalize well for mission-critical UAV scenarios due to dynamic changes in physical environments and limited computing resources. We propose a cooperative GAI framework to achieve a highly accurate and low-latency GAI implementation performance with a double-sized GAI manner. We first propose a model aggregation and splitting algorithm to acquire accurate large-sized GAI models by combining small-sized GAI models using a multimodal-based deep learning method. Then, we propose a model update algorithm to reduce the latency of GAI implementation for real-time service provisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our terminal-edge cooperative GAI framework using a case study of UAV-based target tracking. The results indicate that our solution ensures an accurate GAI implementation with a successful tracking ratio of up to 90% as well as a low system latency of under 2 s compared to the existing GAI pattern on average, respectively.","Zhou, L.; Feng, W.; Chen, Z.; Ruan, T.; Leng, S.; Yang, H.H.; Fu, Y.; Quek, T.Q.S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MVT.2025.3544817,6kbzzwf3n5,,,2,"IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine, Vehicular Technology Magazine, IEEE, IEEE Veh.

"Generative AI (GenAI) tools, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, are rapidly reshaping higher education by transforming how students, educators, and researchers engage with learning, teaching, and academic work. Despite their growing presence, the adoption of GenAI remains inconsistent, largely due to the absence of universal guidelines and trust-related concerns. This study examines how trust, defined across three key dimensions (accuracy and relevance, privacy protection, and nonmaliciousness), influences the adoption and use of GenAI tools in academic environments. Using survey data from 823 participants across different academic roles, this study employs multiple regression analysis to explore the relationship between trust, user characteristics, and behavioral intention. The results reveal that trust is primarily experience-driven. Frequency of use, duration of use, and self-assessed proficiency significantly predict trust, whereas demographic factors, such as gender and academic role, have no significant influence. Furthermore, trust emerges as a strong predictor of behavioral intention to adopt GenAI tools. These findings reinforce trust calibration theory and extend the UTAUT2 framework to the context of GenAI in education. This study highlights that fostering appropriate trust through transparent policies, privacy safeguards, and practical training is critical for enabling responsible, ethical, and effective integration of GenAI into higher education.","Đerić, Elena; Frank, Domagoj; Milković, Marin",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/info16070622,5xxae26pcn,,,7,Information,,,622,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=5xxae26pcn&recordId=5xxae26pcn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Gemini (Chatbot); Trust; Multiple regression analysis; Innovation adoption,"Trust in Generative AI Tools: A Comparative Study of Higher Education Students, Teachers, and Researchers.",16

"As the demand for deep mineral resource extraction intensifies, optimizing pipeline transportation systems in backfill mining has become increasingly critical. Thus, reducing energy loss while ensuring the filling effect becomes crucial for improving process efficiency. Owing to variations among mines, accurately calculating pipeline resistance loss remains challenging, resulting in significant inaccuracies. The rapid development of Industry 4.0 provides intelligent and data-driven optimization ideas for this challenge. This study introduces a novel pipeline resistance loss prediction framework integrating generative artificial intelligence with a TransKAN model. This study employs generative artificial intelligence to produce physically constrained augmented data, integrates the KAN network's B-spline basis functions for nonlinear feature extraction, and incorporates the Transformer architecture to capture spatio-temporal correlations in pipeline pressure sequences, enabling precise resistance loss calculation. The experimental data collected from pipeline pressure sensors provides empirical validation for the model. Compared with traditional mathematical formulas, BP neural networks, SVMs, and random forests, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance, achieving an R2 value of 0.9644, an RMSE of 0.7126, and an MAE of 0.4703.","Zhang, Qinyu; Liu, Huiying; Liu, Zhike; Liu, Yongkang; Gong, Yuhan; Wang, Chonghao",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/s25123803,bx2xp32omj,,,12,Sensors (14248220),,,3803,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=bx2xp32omj&recordId=bx2xp32omj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250615,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Pipeline transportation; Random forest algorithms; Mathematical formulas; Pressure sensors; All Other Pipeline Transportation,Pipe Resistance Loss Calculation in Industry 4.0: An Innovative Framework Based on TransKAN and Generative AI.,25

"This research examines generative AI (GenAI) use in a university course that encouraged ChatGPT for specific assignments. Using the Pedagogical Centered AI (PCAI) framework, we explore how students perceive, use, and position ChatGPT, and how usage patterns influenced performance. Students utilized ChatGPT during the latter half of the Spring 2024 semester. Comparisons were made with the first half of the course and prior iterations (2022 and 2023) without GenAI. All students in the 2024 cohort — 40 students — were invited to participate in the study. Data includes 18 student interviews from the 2024 cohort and student work from all iterations. Interviews underwent qualitative deductive thematic analysis using PCAI’s predefined codes PCAI frames AI in education through six learning theories: behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, social constructivism, experiential learning, and communities of practice. Class materials and academic records were analyzed to assess performance quantitatively using inferential statistics. Findings reveal students predominantly view AI from a behaviorist perspective: as a tool for completing tasks. Some aligned usage with cognitive learning theory by using AI to reduce cognitive load, while others adopted social constructivist or constructivist perspectives, using AI to build understanding through feedback and exam preparation functions. Overuse of ChatGPT correlated with lower grades, though only one student acknowledged its negative impact on learning. We discuss implications for higher education and highlight how ChatGPT supports diverse teaching and learning approaches tailored to students’ needs. In particular, strategies aligned with constructivism, social constructivism, and communities of practice approaches seem to enhance student learning. However, behaviorist approaches to AI use could hinder learning outcomes. Although most students were aware of the negative impact of AI overuse, they also mentioned that minimal training and explanation were provided in other classes, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive program to support AI literacy in higher education","Diaz, Brayan; Chen, Gongfan; Jaselskis, Edward; Delgado, Cesar",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.5281/zenodo.15993999,qgp7jpardv,,,82,Comunicar,,61,47,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=qgp7jpardv&recordId=qgp7jpardv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Oxbridge Publishing House,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Cognitive learning theory; Social constructivism; ChatGPT; Student records; Experiential learning; Constructivism (Psychology),Supporting Generative AI Literacy: Exploring the Pedagogical Roles Students Assign ChatGPT and Impact on Course Grades.,33
"Generative AI tools offer opportunities for enhancing learning and assessment, but raise concerns about equity, academic integrity, and the ability to critically engage with AI-generated content. This study explores these issues within a psychology-oriented postgraduate programme at a UK university. We co-designed and evaluated a novel AI-integrated assessment aimed at improving critical AI literacy among students and teaching staff (pre-registration: osf.io/jqpce). Students were randomly allocated to two groups: the 'compliant' group used AI tools to assist with writing a blog and critically reflected on the outputs, while the 'unrestricted' group had free rein to use AI to produce the assessment. Teaching staff, blinded to group allocation, marked the blogs using an adapted rubric. Focus groups, interviews, and workshops were conducted to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived integrity of the approach. Findings suggest that, when carefully scaffolded, integrating AI into assessments can promote both technical fluency and ethical reflection. A key contribution of this study is its participatory co-design and evaluation method, which was effective and transferable, and is presented as a practical toolkit for educators.

"This paper investigates the impact of the adoption of generative AI on financial stability. We conduct laboratory-style experiments using large language models to replicate classic studies on herd behavior in investment decisions. Our results show that AI agents make more rational decisions than humans, relying predominantly on private information over market trends. Increased reliance on AI-powered investment advice could therefore potentially lead to fewer asset price bubbles arising from animal spirits that trade by following the herd. However, exploring variations in the experimental settings reveals that AI agents can be induced to herd optimally when explicitly guided to make profit-maximizing decisions. While optimal herding improves market discipline, this behavior still carries potential implications for financial stability. In other experimental variations, we show that AI agents are not purely algorithmic, but have inherited some elements of human conditioning and bias.","Hansen, Anne Lundgaard; Lee, Seung Jung",Business Source Ultimate,,10.17016/FEDS.2025.090,lta5myiwzn,,,,Working Papers: U.S. Federal Reserve Board's Finance &amp; Economic Discussion Series,,70,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=lta5myiwzn&recordId=lta5myiwzn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,False,20250901,US Federal Reserve Board,Decision making in investments; Financial accountability; Intelligent agents; Financial markets; Economic equilibrium; Securities and Commodity Exchanges; Investment Banking and Securities Dealing; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Herding; Statistical bias,Financial Stability Implications of Generative AI: Taming the Animal Spirits.,

"artificial intelligence (AI)-native edge networks are promising solutions to seamlessly integrate AI into modern network architectures, promoting intelligent and hyper-flexible behavior in self-adaptation and reconfiguration of hybrid networks. AI-native edge nodes have to promptly react to any change in network conditions and to be linked to Internet of Everything (IoE) deployed in etherogeneous communication domains. This article deals with a next-generation programmable edge node capable of being employed in different domains in a unified and flexible manner. With the aim to achieve a low reconfiguration overhead in such herogeneous contexts, this article proposes the integration of a generative-AI module within an edge node exploiting foundation models for efficient general-purpose time-series prediction, without involving overhead and costs due to models trained from scratch and overcoming data scarcity. This permits to manage IoE networks deployed in both homogeneous and heterogeneous domains, i.e., aqua, ground and air, autonomously, without the need for adjustments from the outside. As foundation models, we focused on Chronos and TimesFM, in both the zero-shot and fine-tuning learning paradigms. Finally, performance results in terms of prediction accuracy, training, and inference time are provided and compared with those achieved by the state-of-the-art recurrent neural network trained from scratch and baseline alternatives.

Recent advancements in Generative AI(GenAI) models have made them a powerful tool for creating and manipulating synthetic images, although these advancements also imply increased complexity and resource demands for training. In this work, we benchmark and combine different GenAI models with TIGs, assessing their effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of the generated test images, in terms of domain validity and label preservation. We conduct an empirical study involving three different GenAI architectures (VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models), five classification tasks of increasing complexity, and 364 human evaluations.

"The increasing deployment of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) require computational support and coverage in applications such as maritime search and rescue. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can offer low-cost, flexible aerial services, and ground stations (GSs) can provide powerful supports, which can cooperate to help the USVs in complex scenarios. However, the collaboration between UAVs and GSs for USVs faces challenges of task uncertainties, USVs trajectory uncertainties, heterogeneities, and limited computational resources. To address these issues, we propose a cooperative UAV and GS based robust multi-access edge computing framework to assist USVs in completing computational tasks. Specifically, we formulate the optimization problem of joint task offloading and UAV trajectory to minimize the total execution time, which is in the form of mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to tackle. Therefore, we propose the algorithm of generative artificial intelligence-enhanced heterogeneous agent proximal policy optimization (GAI-HAPPO). The proposed algorithm integrates GAI models to enhance the actor network ability to model complex environments and extract high-level features, thereby allowing the algorithm to predict uncertainties and adapt to dynamic conditions. Additionally, GAI stabilizes the critic network, addressing the instability of multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing benchmark methods, thus highlighting the potentials in tackling intricate, cross-domain issues in the considered scenarios.","You, Jiahao; Jia, Ziye; Dong, Chao; Wu, Qihui; Han, Zhu",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CISS64860.2025.10944752,w5osdgzzkj,,,,"2025 59th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS), Information Sciences and Systems (CISS), 2025 59th Annual Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250319,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Adaptation models; Uncertainty; Heuristic algorithms; Computational modeling; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Prediction algorithms; Feature extraction; Trajectory; Vehicle dynamics; Optimization; Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs); unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); multi-access edge computing (MEC); multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL); <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (GAI)",Generative AI-Enhanced Cooperative MEC of UAVs and Ground Stations for Unmanned Surface Vehicles,

The Generator utilizes the environment and system specifications to generate both traditional and zero-day attack vectors. The Executor classifies attacks, assigns them to specialized workers for execution, and consolidates the results into a comprehensive report. The Defender then analyzes this report to iteratively enhance the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This iterative process enhances the system’s resilience and robustness to future, unknown threats. The framework is adaptable, allowing customization to meet the security needs of various organizations making it well-suited for applications such as enterprise cloud security, cybersecurity education, and beyond.

"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the world [1]. Mortality rates stand at 27 percent in India and 60 in Africa, compared to 7 in the US [2]. This disconnect boils down to the time of diagnosis. According to the CDC late-stage diagnosis has a five-year mortality rate of 69 percent, compared to 2 percent for early diagnosis [3]. Underserved communities lack access to high-cost, advanced diagnostic tech-nologies (MRIs/Mammograms) and cancer specialists (Oncolo-gists/Radiologists) [4]. Patients must depend on low-cost, low-resolution modalities (Ultrasounds) and the limited breast cancer expertise of general physicians (and gynecologists in developing countries), significantly delaying diagnosis and subsequent in-tervention [5]. This study aims to reduce global breast cancer mortality and healthcare costs by enabling accurate, early, and low-cost diagnosis using the existing ultrasound infrastructure in developing countries and underserved communities. To address data scarcity and skew, advanced image augmentation techniques such as deep convolutional GANs and stable diffusion models were evaluated. In each case of data augmentation, two classification approaches were compared: a lightweight MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network and a hybrid model combining ResNet50 for feature extraction with statistical machine learning models. The highest detection accuracy (95 percent) was achieved using the hybrid model with ResNet50 and XGBoost, paired with Stable Diffusion augmentation.

Our paper proposes a solution to increase adherence to the EGRA criteria while ensuring narrative diversity by utilizing GPT-4o to generate children's reading comprehension stories, guided by a database of classic tales. We present a systematic autoregressive framework that incorporates self-reflection to enhance and refine the quality of the stories generated. The stories are evaluated through both automated metrics and human assessment. Our results demonstrate GPT-4o's potential to improve resource efficiency and scalability in literacy assessment practices, providing practical solutions for educators and policymakers in early grade learning.","Syed, Taufiq; Shankarnarayanan, Aadhith; Kaddoura, Yara; Shapsough, Salsabeel; Zualkernan, Imran; Kochmar, Ekaterina",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICALT64023.2025.00058,ekqw5zxtwr,,,,"2025 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT), Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT), 2025 IEEE International Conference on, ICALT",,185,183,,True,20250714,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Measurement; Systematics; Statistical analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Databases; Large language models; Scalability; Natural language processing; Cognition; Standards; Early Grade Reading Assessment; Technology-enhanced learning; Comprehension; Large Language Models; GPT-4o; Story Generation",Generative AI for Early Grade Story Generation Using a Self-Reflective Approach,
"This study investigated pre-service teachers' (PTs) intentions to adopt generative AI (GenAI) tools in future classrooms by applying an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Participants were enrolled in multiple teacher-preparation programs within a single U.S. higher education institution. Through a structured GenAI-integrated activity using Khanmigo, a domain-specific AI platform for K-12 education, PTs explored AI-supported instructional tasks. Post-activity data were analyzed using PLS-SEM. The results showed that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease-of-use (PEU), and self-efficacy (SE) significantly predicted behavioral intention (BI) to adopt GenAI, with SE also influencing both PU and PEU. Conversely, personal innovativeness in IT and perceived cyber risk showed insignificant effects on BI or PU. The findings underscored the evolving dynamics of TAM constructs in GenAI contexts and highlighted the need to reconceptualize ease-of-use and risk within AI-mediated environments. Practically, the study emphasized the importance of preparing PTs not only to operate AI tools but also to critically interpret and co-design them. These insights inform both theoretical models and teacher education strategies, supporting the ethical and pedagogically meaningful integration of GenAI in K-12 education. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Liu, Yang; Wang, Qiu; Lei, Jing",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/bs15081040,55swtbhxwn,,,8,Behavioral Sciences (2076-328X),,,1040,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=55swtbhxwn&recordId=55swtbhxwn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Technology Acceptance Model; Teacher education; Perceived benefit; Student teachers; Preparedness; Educators; Self-efficacy; United States,Adopting Generative AI in Future Classrooms: A Study of Preservice Teachers' Intentions and Influencing Factors.,15
"Metal ions, as abundant and vital cofactors in numerous proteins, are crucial for enzymatic activities and protein interactions. Given their pivotal role and catalytic efficiency, accurately and efficiently identifying metal-binding sites is fundamental to elucidating their biological functions and has significant implications for protein engineering and drug discovery. To address this challenge, we present SuperMetal, a generative AI framework that leverages a score-based diffusion model coupled with a confidence model to predict metal-binding sites in proteins with high precision and efficiency. Using zinc ions as an example, SuperMetal outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving a precision of 94 % and coverage of 90 %, with zinc ions localization within 0.52 ± 0.55 Å of experimentally determined positions, thus marking a substantial advance in metal-binding site prediction. Furthermore, SuperMetal demonstrates rapid prediction capabilities (under 10 s for proteins with ∼ 2000 residues) and remains minimally affected by increases in protein size. Notably, SuperMetal does not require prior knowledge of the number of metal ions—unlike AlphaFold 3, which depends on this information. Additionally, SuperMetal can be readily adapted to other metal ions or repurposed as a probe framework to identify other types of binding sites, such as protein-binding pockets. Scientific contribution SuperMetal introduces a diffusion-based, SE(3)-equivariant generative model that places metal ions in proteins with 94 % precision, 90 % coverage, and sub-ångström (0.52 Å) accuracy in under 10 s, surpassing current methods and accelerating metal-aware protein engineering and drug discovery.","Lin, Xiaobo; Su, Zhaoqian; Liu, Yunchao; Liu, Jingxian; Kuang, Xiaohan; Cummings, Peter T.; Spencer-Smith, Jesse; Meiler, Jens",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1186/s13321-025-01038-9,kwvzwtec3f,,,1,Journal of Cheminformatics,,12,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=kwvzwtec3f&recordId=kwvzwtec3f&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250715,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Drug discovery; Zinc ions; Protein engineering; Metal ions; Research and Development in Biotechnology,SuperMetal: a generative AI framework for rapid and precise metal ion location prediction in proteins.,17

"Academic writing is an important part of scholarly development and a key opportunity to practice scientific, critical thinking. Among its types such as seminar papers, term papers, case studies, and project reports—essay writing stands out for its open-ended nature. These formats challenge students to apply their present knowledge to real-world or simulated scenarios, often without a clearly defined path to a solution. This ambiguity showcases professional environments, where complete information is rarely available. With the advent of AI systems like Gemini, Copilot and ChatGPT, the landscape of academic writing has shifted. Unlike traditional programming, these applications allow users to issue instructions in natural language, making them more accessible collaborators. However, to use them effectively, users must learn to craft clear and purposeful prompts. This paper introduces the BITE approach—Behavioral instructions, Interaction modeling, Task elaboration, and External context—as a practical framework for writing effective and uncomplicated prompts. Prompts in the GPT world are instructions in natural language. We do not have to learn programming-specific syntax to get the machine to do something but can speak to it more or less in the same way as we would speak to a human collaborator. The BITE method supports active learning by encouraging students to engage critically with AI applications/tools during their writing process. Preliminary testing show that applying BITE leads to more coherent and desirable outputs and improved writing efficiency compared to unstructured prompting strategies used in both academic and industry settings.","Robinson, Rachel John",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ACDSA65407.2025.11166041,bc6bhbbp5f,,,,"2025 International Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>, Computer, Data Sciences and Applications (ACDSA), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>, Computer, Data Sciences and Applications (ACDSA), 2025 International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250807,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas; Engineering Profession; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Photonics and Electrooptics; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Seminars; Adaptation models; Active learning; Natural languages; Writing; Syntactics; Search engines; Chatbots; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Testing; Academic writing; <mark>AI</mark> systems; natural language prompts; BITE approach; Active Learning",The Prompt culture in Generative AI for Active Learning,

"The potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to support teachers in providing a more equitable, inclusive, comprehensive, rigorous advanced academics cannot be ignored. GenAI alone is not enough to sustain learning, but when it is guided by a human teacher who knows each student's learning profiles, then realization of potential talent is endless. Educator preparation programs (EPP) must provide guidance, support, and resources so that preservice teachers can maximize the benefits of GenAI while maintaining high ethical expectations. EPPs must develop programming aligned with standards of practice established by CEC, ISTE, and TPACK to prepare educators. If they do not, one must question if EPPs are falling short of their responsibility to prepare preservice teachers to use GenAI as an instructional and pedagogical strategy.

"Objective: To determine accuracy and efficiency of using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to undertake thematic analysis. Introduction: With the increasing use of GenAI in data analysis, testing the reliability and suitability of using GenAI to conduct qualitative data analysis is needed. We propose a method for researchers to assess reliability of GenAI outputs using deidentified qualitative datasets. Methods: We searched three databases (United Kingdom Data Service, Figshare, and Google Scholar) and five journals (PlosOne, Social Science and Medicine, Qualitative Inquiry, Qualitative Research, Sociology Health Review) to identify studies on health-related topics, published prior to whereby: humans undertook thematic analysis and published both their analysis in a peer-reviewed journal and the associated dataset. We prompted a closed system GenAI (Microsoft Copilot) to undertake thematic analysis of these datasets and analysed the GenAI outputs in comparison with human outputs. Measures include time (GenAI only), accuracy, overlap with human analysis, and reliability of selected data and quotes. Results: Five studies were identified that met our inclusion criteria. The themes identified by human researchers and Copilot showed minimal overlap, with human researchers often using discursive thematic analyses (40%) and Copilot focusing on thematic analysis (100%). Copilot's outputs often included fabricated quotes (58% SD = 45%) and none of the Copilot outputs provided participant spread by theme. Additionally, Copilot's outputs primarily drew themes and quotes from the first 2-3 pages of textual data, rather than from the entire dataset. Human researchers provided broader representation and accurate quotes (79% quotes were correct, SD = 27%). Conclusions: Based on these results, we cannot recommend the current version of Copilot for undertaking thematic analyses. This study raises concerns about the validity of both human-generated and GenAI-generated qualitative data analysis and reporting.","Jowsey, Tanisha; Stapleton, Peta; Campbell, Shawna; Davidson, Alexandra; McGillivray, Cher; Maugeri, Isabella; Lee, Megan; Keogh, Justin",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1371/journal.pone.0330217,5ye7zqcvdz,,,9,PLoS ONE,,13,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=5ye7zqcvdz&recordId=5ye7zqcvdz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250905,Public Library of Science,Thematic analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Content analysis; Statistical reliability; Qualitative research,"Frankenstein, thematic analysis and generative artificial intelligence: Quality appraisal methods and considerations for qualitative research.",20
"The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true, generally intelligent, and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this article, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.","Xiao, Yong; Shi, Guangming; Zhang, Ping",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MCOM.001.2500005,cuvttffblz,,,9,"IEEE Communications Magazine, Communications Magazine, IEEE, IEEE Commun.

"Data warehousing is a complex process that poses challenges for students, particularly in understanding star schema design, SQL coding, and ETL processes. To address these difficulties, we developed a ChatGPT-powered chatbot designed to guide users step-by-step in creating data warehouses, generating SQL code, and providing educational support for learning these concepts interactively.This work demonstrates the integration of multiple STEM disciplines by combining computer science (natural language processing, software engineering), mathematics (schema modeling, data relationships), and engineering principles (system design, iterative refinement) into a unified learning experience. The chatbot’s approach helps students understand how these disciplines interconnect in real-world applications, reinforcing the fundamental interdisciplinary nature of data engineering education.This proof of concept project aimed to test the chatbot’s effectiveness in enhancing student confidence, reducing SQL errors, and improving learning outcomes. We conducted structured trials where students interacted with the chatbot to design a star schema, create and query tables using SQL, and understand data warehousing principles.The results demonstrated an improvement in student confidence (110% increase) and improvement in SQL success rate (from 60% to 95%). Participants noted that the chatbot simplified the learning process by providing accurate SQL code and reducing the cognitive load associated with debugging and syntax management. However, minor challenges, such as incorrect table creation order in some cases, were identified and highlighted areas for refinement.The findings suggest that the chatbot can effectively serve as a scalable educational tool, offering both theoretical and practical benefits. It enables educators to streamline teaching processes and students to gain hands-on experience with immediate feedback. Future work will involve refining the chatbot’s error-handling capabilities, expanding its application to other domains such as advanced database concepts, and integrating visual aids for better comprehension.This project demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools to transform technical education by reducing barriers to entry and enhancing learning efficiency.

"The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced both opportunities and challenges in the fight against misinformation. This scoping review synthesizes recent empirical studies to explore the dual role of generative AI—particularly large language models (LLMs)—in the generation, detection, mitigation, and impact of misinformation. Analyzing 24 empirical studies, our review suggests that LLMs can generate highly convincing misinformation, often exploiting cognitive biases and ideological leanings of the audiences, while also demonstrating the ability to detect false claims and enhance users’ resistance to misinformation. Mitigation efforts show mixed results, with personalized corrections proving effective but safeguards inconsistently applied. Additionally, exposure to AI-generated misinformation was found to reduce trust and influence decision-making. This review underscores the need for standardized evaluation metrics, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger regulatory measures to ensure the responsible use of generative AI in the information ecosystem.","Park, Seyeon; Nan, Xiaoli",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s00146-025-02620-3,qjfturbzar,,,,"<mark>AI</mark> &amp; SOCIETY: Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Communication",,15,1,,False,20250930,Springer London,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Misinformation; Fake news; Large language models; LLM,"Generative AI and misinformation: a scoping review of the role of generative AI in the generation, detection, mitigation, and impact of misinformation",
"High-quality feedback requires understanding of a student's work, insights into what concepts would help them improve, and language that matches the preferences of the specific teaching team. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate coherent feedback, adapting these responses to align with specific teacher preferences remains an open challenge. We present a method for aligning LLM-generated feedback with teacher preferences using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We integrate preference data collection into the grading process. This creates a self-improving pipeline keeping the teacher-in-the-loop to ensure feedback quality and maintain teacher autonomy. To evaluate effectiveness, we conducted a blind controlled study where expert evaluators compared feedback from multiple models on anonymized student submissions. Evaluators consistently preferred feedback from our DPO model over GPT-4o. We deployed the system in two offerings of a large university course, with nearly 300 students and over 10 teaching assistants per term, demonstrating its feasibility in real classroom settings.

"This study aims to understand how faculty members at higher education institutions in Pakistan respond to the opportunities and challenges associated with using GAI in teaching and learning. The research employed a phenomenological approach within the qualitative research tradition. Data were collected from 33 university faculty members through semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed thematically. Our analysis identified that ethical issues and overreliance were significant challenges to the use of GAI. Key ethical challenges included data privacy and security and the unethical use of GAI in exams and assessments. Shortcomings in GAI's ability to produce unreliable outputs in instances could lead to potential bias due to over reliance on it. Overreliance may also compromise human values and privacy, replace human critical thinking capabilities, and encourage cheating and plagiarism. The key opportunities associated with the use of GAI included improved learning outcomes and contextual integration of GAI. Using GAI was found to improve knowledge acquisition and research efficiency, offering access to a vast amount of information, entertaining personalized learning needs, and generating course content. Tailored use in specific subjects or learning scenarios was also found to be an opportunity associated with the use of GAI. It was also found beneficial for use in data-intensive processes such as analyzing a long text or summarizing a report. Although there are some shortcomings that need to be addressed, the findings confirm that GAI is a valuable tool for education. It has the potential to transform into an invaluable asset for faculty and students alike, enriching their learning experiences.

"Looking back at the progress made in cybersecurity regulation in the EU, significant accomplishments have been achieved. Looking to the future, this paper argues that further milestones in cybersecurity regulation could be attained through comprehensive integration with diverse legal frameworks related to ICT technologies, and in particular by combating the proliferation and misuse of tools that have the potential to facilitate cyberattacks and cybercrime. Within this framework, the present research is primarily focused on Generative AI and the need to prevent its malicious use for cyber-attacks and cybercrime: alongside the criminal prosecution of cybercrime and the established “protective” legal framework of cybersecurity regulation, the forward-looking perspective should also encompass a complementary strategy for mitigating cyber risks and cyber threats related to Generative AI, in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity.",Maria Vittoria Zucca; Gaia Fiorinelli,OpenAIRE,,10.71265/23nqtq40,xewywlily5,,,,Technology and Regulation,,262,247,,False,20250702,Open Press Tilburg University,Cybersecurity; Criminal law; <mark>AI</mark>; Cybercrime; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Electronic computers.

"This study investigates the influence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) on university students' learning outcomes, employing a technology-mediated learning perspective. We developed and empirically tested an integrated model, grounded in interaction theory and technology-mediated learning theory, to examine the relationships between GAI interaction quality, GAI output quality, and learning outcomes. The model incorporates motivational factors (learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, and creative self-efficacy) as mediators and creative thinking as a moderator. Data from 323 Chinese university students, collected through a two-wave longitudinal survey, revealed that both GAI interaction quality and output quality positively influenced learning motivation and creative self-efficacy. Learning motivation significantly mediated the relationship between GAI output quality and learning outcomes. Furthermore, creative thinking moderated several pathways within the model, with some variations observed across the two time points. These findings provide theoretical and practical insights into the effective integration of GAI tools in higher education, highlighting the importance of both interaction and output quality in optimizing student learning experiences.","Bai, Yun; Wang, Shaofeng",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1038/s41598-025-08697-6,pqdvrybeiz,,,1,Scientific Reports,,16,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=pqdvrybeiz&recordId=pqdvrybeiz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250705,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Cognitive psychology; Chinese-speaking students; Creative thinking; Educational outcomes,Impact of generative AI interaction and output quality on university students' learning outcomes: a technology-mediated and motivation-driven approach.,15
"The programming curriculum is crucial in today's digital age, but a common issue is its focus on technical training while neglecting essential skills enhancement. Teachers lack structured and practical guidance on instructional methods, and the wide range of students' foundational abilities makes it difficult to cater to personalized learning needs. The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology has brought significant changes to education, with its personalized dialogue features offering effective technical support to address these challenges in programming education. This study develops a GAI-supported programming learning approach, applied in a programming course at a vocational school in China, to investigate the effects of various learning approaches on students' learning outcomes, motivation, self-efficacy, and 5C competencies among different learning styles. The study involved 46 learners in the experimental group using GAI-assisted learning and 46 in the control group using traditional methods. Results showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in learning outcomes, motivation, self-efficacy, and 5C competencies. Moreover, students with a diverging learning style in the experimental group showed notably higher motivation than others. Additionally, creativity levels among students with diverging and assimilating learning styles in the experimental group were substantially greater than those in the control group.","Li, Hao-Jun; Huang, Qin-Ru; Wen, Li-Peng; Chen, Wei; Xu, Zhuo-Zhuo",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1177/21582440251377986,leflxdvyyz,,,3,SAGE Open,,20,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=leflxdvyyz&recordId=leflxdvyyz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Sage Publications Inc.,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Computer programming education; Cognitive styles; Occupational training; Effective teaching; Core competencies; Academic motivation; Individualized instruction; China; Vocational Rehabilitation Services; Computer systems design and related services (except video game design and development); Other Computer Related Services; Custom Computer Programming Services,Generative Artificial Intelligence Supported Programming Learning: Learning Effectiveness and Core Competence.,15
"This paper investigates the impact of the usage of generative AI (GenAI) and services with integrated GenAI on employee performance, alongside with the role of trusting in these tools and services. Employing a mixed methodology, the research first analyzes data from 251 professionals in Spain using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach, followed by a qualitative survey of 69 top academics in management sciences. Findings indicate that the adoption and effective use of GenAI services does not directly improve workplace performance. Instead, an optimal level of trust in these services plays a critical mediating role, enhancing work engagement and thereby performance. The study draws on the reviewed job demand-resources theory (JD-R) to construct a new theoretical framework of applied in GenAI services, offering insights into how user experience and trust influence engagement and productivity. For managers, these results highlight the importance of building an optimal level of trust in GenAI among employees and users of services with integrated GenAI to boost work engagement and performance.","Marimon, Frederic; Mas-Machuca, Marta; Akhmedova, Anna",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1080/10447318.2024.2388482,fmzzumhilf,,,11,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,,7091,7076,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=fmzzumhilf&recordId=fmzzumhilf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Job performance; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Trust; Job involvement; Structural equation modeling,Trusting in Generative AI: Catalyst for Employee Performance and Engagement in the Workplace.,41
"Education 4.0 increasingly relies on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to personalize learning experiences and provide personalized tools that improve student engagement and comprehension. Its capacity for analyzing enormous volumes of data enables educators to design adaptable lessons that satisfy the various demands of students in a society that is becoming increasingly digitalized and interconnected. This study examines GenAI's undergraduate intentions for enhanced learning from the planned behavior theory (PBT) perspective. Based on the convenience sampling technique, an online survey was conducted, and 122 undergraduates attending a Nigerian public university responded to the same. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data collected for measurement and structural model assessment. Evaluation of the measurement model revealed the reliability and validity of the factor loading and the constructs, while the structural model assessment was used to test the hypotheses, the effects of the paths, and the model's predictive relevance. The result shows that attitudes toward GenAI do not influence its actual use among undergraduates but rather influence intention to use GenAI. Furthermore, the intention to use GenAI influences its actual use. In addition, perceived control concerning GenAI influences the intention to use and the actual use of GenAI. However, subjective norms concerning GenAI do not influence the intention to use GenAI. PBT core factors positively influence undergraduate intent to use GenAI, and behavioral intention influences the actual use of GenAI. This study stresses the need for motivating components like perceived behavioral control (PBC) in determining intention and actual use of GenAI.","Falebita, Oluwanife Segun; Kok, Petrus Jacobus",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.18848/1832-3669/CGP/v21i01/169-188,m7i4bjsibn,,,1,"International Journal of Technology, Knowledge &amp; Society: Annual Review",,188,169,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=m7i4bjsibn&recordId=m7i4bjsibn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,Common Ground Research Networks,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Planned behavior theory; Digital learning; Attitude (Psychology); Student engagement; Data analysis; Perceived control (Psychology); Undergraduate education,Undergraduate Intentions of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Enhanced Learning: Influence of Attitude and Perceived Behavioral Control.,21
"Large Language models have shown a remarkable ability to ""converse"" with humans in a natural language across myriad topics. Despite the proliferation of these models, a deep understanding of how they work under the hood remains elusive. The core of these Generative AI models is composed of layers of neural networks that employ the Transformer architecture. This architecture learns from large amounts of training data and creates new content in response to user input. In this study, we analyze the internals of the Transformer using Information Theory. To quantify the amount of information passing through a layer, we view it as an information transmission channel and compute the capacity of the channel. The highlight of our study is that, using Information-Theoretical tools, we develop techniques to visualize on an Information plane how the Transformer encodes the relationship between words in sentences while these words are projected into a high-dimensional vector space. We use Information Geometry to analyze the high-dimensional vectors in the Transformer layer and infer relationships between words based on the length of the geodesic connecting these vector distributions on a Riemannian manifold. Our tools reveal more information about these relationships than attention scores. In this study, we also show how Information-Theoretic analysis can help in troubleshooting learning problems in the Transformer layers.","Deb, Manas; Ogunfunmi, Tokunbo",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/e27060589,sj6n3gsd5j,,,6,Entropy,,,589,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=sj6n3gsd5j&recordId=sj6n3gsd5j&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Information geometry; Language models; Information theory; Transformer models,Information-Theoretical Analysis of a Transformer-Based Generative AI Model.,27
"Educators believe that using technology in education will be more effective for the new generation of learners. Therefore, we propose an educational technology platform called Hakawati that supports educators’ teaching methods and students’ learning skills by utilizing artificial intelligence capabilities based on text-to-speech (TTS) and text generation technologies. For the story-generation component of Hakawati, we employed a pretrained transformer model called Turbo 3.5. This model creates coherent narratives from various prompts, perfectly satisfying the goal of transforming lessons into stories. To ensure the effectiveness of the models, subjective evaluations were conducted using measures, such as relevance, coherence, story completeness, language, and grammar. To convert the generated stories into speech, Coqui_XTTS version 2 and StyleTTS were evaluated using a subjective mean opinion score for naturalness and understandability. Coqui_XTTS outperformed its counterpart, with the language model scoring 4.44 out of 5, whereas StyleTTS scored 1.7 out of 5. This demonstrates the ability of Coqui_XTTS to generate high-quality natural speech, add an immersive auditory element to the story, and enhance the user experience.","Alghamdi, Norah Saleh; Alqasayer, Lina Abdullah; Abuhaimed, Nouf Abdulaziz; Alotaibi, Reyouf Mansour; Alsaif, Renad Fahad",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ACDSA65407.2025.11166230,n32nksi3gv,,,,"2025 International Conference on <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>, Computer, Data Sciences and Applications (ACDSA), <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>, Computer, Data Sciences and Applications (ACDSA), 2025 International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250807,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas; Engineering Profession; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Photonics and Electrooptics; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Large language models; Transforms; Learning (<mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>); Coherence; Machine learning; Transformers; Natural language processing; User experience; Text to speech; Research and development; text-to-speech (TTS); text generation; <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (<mark>AI</mark>); machine learning; natural language processing (NLP); storytelling; young learners; language learning; large language model",A Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-Powered Platform for an Educational Story-teller,
"The CRC-aided successive cancellation list (CA-SCL) decoding algorithm for polar codes has gained widespread adoption thanks to its outstanding performance. However, with the evolution of 6G technologies, the high complexity of CA-SCL decoding poses a challenge in meeting growing performance requirements. Consequently, it is crucial to devise strategies that reduce this complexity without compromising error rates. Current efforts to mitigate the complexity mainly depend on harnessing special nodes associated with the code construction sequences, such as Fast-SCL decoding. However, these strategies suffer from redundant complexity due to ill-suited construction sequences and unnecessary sorting operations within special nodes. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly and GenAI-aided complexity reduction approach for Fast-SCL decoding, named GenPolar. This approach involves two-step optimization techniques: 1) Transformer encoder models for generating polar construction sequences, and 2) a sorting entropy based method for sorting reduction. These two-step techniques result in reduced complexity with negligible performance loss. For polar codes of length-1024 with code rates of 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, GenPolar achieves latency reductions of 20.6%, 29.8%, and 40.6%, respectively. Even benchmarking against the reduced-complexity version of Fast-SCL decoding, the relative gains are 14.0%, 17.8%, and 22.3%, respectively. It should be noted that the immediate application is not limited to Fast-SCL decoding but also extends to other node-based SCL decoding algorithms like SSCL-SPC and SR-SCL.","Sun, Y.; Chen, J.; Ren, Y.; Ji, H.; Huang, Y.; You, X.; Zhang, C.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JETCAS.2025.3561330,zqnif4c43f,,,2,"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, IEEE Journal on, IEEE J.

Through a critical thematic analysis of 63 blog posts and news articles we sought to understand how instructional guides suggested integrating GenAI tools and the potential implications of these suggestions. We found that the examined texts primarily focused on how GenAI could enhance practitioners' efficiency, paying limited attention to the possible ethical implications of delegating public relations work to machines. We highlight potential ethical issues associated with GenAI taking over a significant portion of the writing tasks in public relations, and we argue that PR needs to develop alternative ways to utilize GenAI while preserving the unique contributions of human practitioners.

"Recently, several applications and specialized versions of ChatGPT have been developed to either create personalized exercise programs based on the fitness levels of practitioners or to provide post-exercise nutrition and recovery advice. However, existing specialized ChatGPTs are limited to specific tasks, and not well-finetuned. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of ChatGPT as a personalized assistant capable of correcting improper postures and analyzing body compositions. We trained ChatGPT to improve posture during exercises and daily activities, thereby enhancing its role as an assistant to prevent injuries and optimize training effectiveness. In addition, we explore ChatGPT's potential to understand body compositions and predict physical transformations, providing users with insights into the outcomes of their fitness and nutrition efforts. Our results indicate that the current ChatGPT model can identify and correct incorrect postures, but struggles to provide visual aids for the correction. It can also provide training schedules and nutrition plans based on requirements, but those plans tend to be general and lack customization. In terms of body composition, ChatGPT can analyze body fat on a broader scale, but with less sensitivity to smaller changes in body fat. The performance of ChatGPT can be further improved using more image datasets related to gym exercises, human postures, and body compositions.","Li, Jiaye; Abouzahir, Saad; El Saddik, Abdulmotaleb",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MeMeA65319.2025.11068068,xq2tmh7a5f,,,,"2025 IEEE Medical Measurements &amp; Applications (MeMeA), Medical Measurements &amp; Applications (MeMeA), 2025 IEEE",,5,1,,True,20250528,IEEE,Bioengineering; Engineering Profession; Training; Visualization; Schedules; Accuracy; Sensitivity; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large language models; Chatbots; Fats; Reliability; Large Language Model; Fitness Coaching; Posture Analysis; Well-being,Integrating Generative AI for Enhanced Fitness Coaching: From Exercise form to Posture and Body Composition Analysis,
"This paper introduces CognitiveOS, the first operating system designed for cognitive robots capable of functioning across diverse robotic platforms. CognitiveOS is structured as a multi-agent system comprising modules built upon a transformer architecture, facilitating communication through an internal monologue format. These modules collectively empower the robot to tackle intricate real-world tasks. The paper delineates the operational principles of the system along with the descriptions of its nine distinct modules. The modular design endows the system with distinctive advantages over traditional end-to-end methodologies, notably in terms of adaptability and scalability. The system's modules are configurable, modifiable, or deactivatable depending on the task requirements, while new modules can be seamlessly integrated. This system serves as a foundational resource for researchers and developers in the Cognitive Robotics domain, alleviating the burden of constructing a cognitive robot system from scratch.

"To create, evaluate, and compare different technologies of home health monitoring, people need lots of sensor data that captures (1) residents' activities of daily living (ADL) like bathing, and (2) their usage of home appliances like watching TV. Unfortunately, such datasets of real-world monitoring are quite limited and scarce, due to issues like sensor cost, technique complexity, and deployment time. Existing simulators attempt to resolve these issues, by generating synthetic data based on predefined models or interactions with users. However, they give little consideration to personas, and rarely support personalized simulation based on humans' age, lifestyles, or health conditions. This paper introduces our novel investigation of using ChatGPT to create usable and shareable datasets of (1) human daily activities, and (2) their usage of home appliances. Specifically, there are two phases in our investigation. First, we described personas of home residents and layouts of home appliances, in order to use ChatGPT to generate data that mimic human behaviors and schedule their usage of appliances. Second, we analyzed and visualized the generated data to check whether the data is meaningful. Our results show great promise: the daily activities of different humans match the described personas, and the simulated appliance usage resembles the typical appliance usage in real-world settings. Our work may shed light on future directions of ADL simulation. It also facilitates studies on home health monitoring, disease diagnosis, and home automation.","Sarvaiya, Harditya; Hasegawa, Masaki; Zeng, Haibo; Gao, Xinghua; Meng, Na",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICPS65515.2025.11087850,fkkvkeivmv,,,,"2025 IEEE 8th International Conference on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), 2025 IEEE 8th International Conference on",,7,1,,True,20250512,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Transportation; Home appliances; Schedules; TV; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Layout; Smart homes; Chatbots; Medical diagnosis; Monitoring; Synthetic data; ChatGPT; simulation; activities of daily living (ADL); persona; lifestyles; personalization",Simulating Personalized Smart-Home Activity Datasets with Generative AI: A Case Study,
"This paper presents the methodology for using LLMs to ease core network signaling analysis. This is done by applying RAG techniques to process standards that describe protocol data formats - and then asking natural language questions about actual capture traces. Analyzing 5G networks is very challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of signaling protocols. Unlike previous generations, protocol fields and values are described in a human-readable format, enabling textual post-processing, and the direct application of LLM models. Intent-based network management involves natural language-based human interaction with the networking equipment so the desired outcome is achieved without step-by-step instructions and settings by the human. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses the combination of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Langchain to automatically answer human questions regarding signalling data. This toolchain makes the analysis part of network fault management intent-based. Moreover, by training LLMs on a vast corpus of standardized signaling data, we demonstrate the model's ability to generate realistic test data. This approach improves the efficiency of automated test environments, ensuring the reliability and performance of networks in real-world conditions.","Tothfalusi, Tamas; Csiszar, Zoltan; Varga, Pal",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/NOMS57970.2025.11073654,icjpsrbhgn,,,,"NOMS 2025-2025 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium, Network Operations and Management Symposium, NOMS 2025-2025 IEEE",,7,1,,True,20250512,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; Training; Protocols; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Retrieval augmented generation; Natural languages; Network analyzers; Data models; Communications technology; Telecommunication network reliability; Standards",TACO - A Generative AI Copilot for Intent-Based Telecommunication Core Network Analysis,
"This study investigated the effectiveness of different GenAI-driven feedback prompts in improving college students’ learning of classical Chinese poetry. A four-week quasi-experimental intervention was conducted with 79 college students, divided into two groups: the experimental group received progressive text GenAI feedback, while the control group received one-time text feedback. The study examined the impact of these feedback methods on students’ cognitive load, learning motivation, understanding, aesthetic emotional experience, and critical thinking. The intervention focused on four classical Chinese poems with a think-feel-aloud (TFA) protocol. The results showed that the progressive feedback method significantly enhanced students’ learning motivation, comprehension, and aesthetic emotional engagement with the poetry. However, there was no significant difference in cognitive load and critical thinking between the two groups, suggesting that while the GenAI feedback improved certain aspects of poetry learning, it did not foster critical thinking to a measurable extent within the intervention duration of this study.","Wang, Yi; Luo, Zichen; Guo, Dongpo; Zhou, Zhijin; Paas, Fred",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CSTE64638.2025.11092104,oda2frpjm5,,,,"2025 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE), 2025 7th International Conference on",,537,533,,True,20250418,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computer science; Protocols; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Cognitive load; Chinese poetry learning; Text-GenAI; Progressive feedback prompt",Impacts of a progressive feedback prompt-based text-generative AI approach on Chinese poetry learning,
"Modern communication systems face challenges in replicating jammer behaviors when interference parameters are unknown. This study explores the use of Stable Diffusion, fine-tuned with LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate high-level, text-based abstractions that characterize unknown interference patterns. By utilizing a single jammer and receiver, and providing spectrogram images of the received signals, the model is able to generate reasonable representations of the interference. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined signal models, our approach enables the synthesis of interference spectrograms without prior knowledge of jammer parameters or transmitted signals. By leveraging diffusion models, we provide a scalable and flexible framework for approximating and representing unknown interference, offering a novel direction for abstracted interference modeling in software-defined radio (SDR) systems.","Tylek, Matthew; Truongcao, Keith; Hossain, Md Shakir; Dandekar, Kapil R.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/WAMICON64429.2025.11004115,aitfcqkv7v,,,,"2025 IEEE Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference (WAMICON), Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference (WAMICON), 2025 IEEE",,4,1,,True,20250414,IEEE,"Aerospace; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; Photonics and Electrooptics; Wireless communication; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Retrieval augmented generation; LoRa; Interference; Receivers; Real-time systems; Jamming; Spectrogram; Software radio; Software-defined radio; Stable diffusion; LoRA; Waveform synthesis; Interference modeling; IQ data",Generative AI for Wireless Interference Modeling: Text-Controlled Waveform Synthesis Using Stable Diffusion,

"As Web APIs become integral to modern digital ecosystems, their increasing complexity and widespread adoption have made them appealing targets for cyberattacks. Effective detection and prevention mechanisms are crucial, and machine learning (ML) techniques provide promising solutions for identifying anomalous API traffic and addressing emerging threats. However, the effectiveness of ML-based security models is limited by the scarcity of realistic, up-to-date datasets and the rapid obsolescence of static training data in the face of evolving attack methodologies. To address these challenges, we present an approach that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic Web API attack datasets. By leveraging LLMs, researchers can access abundant, customizable, and domain-specific synthetic data that closely simulate contemporary traffic patterns. This eliminates privacy and security concerns associated with real-world datasets and ensures a continuously adaptable data source for training and refining ML-based Intrusion Detection Systems. Ultimately, this strategy enables the development of more resilient ML models capable of effectively countering the dynamic and sophisticated nature of modern Web API threats.","Pawana, I Wayan Adi Juliawan; Purnama, Fajar; Linawati; Kim, YoungJae; You, Ilsun",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICCT-Pacific63901.2025.11012893,dcqj2esryr,,,,"2025 1st International Conference on Consumer Technology (ICCT-Pacific), Consumer Technology (ICCT-Pacific), 2025 1st International Conference on",,4,1,,True,20250329,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Data privacy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Biological system modeling; Training data; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Aging; Data models; Synthetic data; LLM; Data Augmentation; Web API; Intrusion Detection System; Privacy",Generative AI for Cybersecurity: LLM-Driven Attack Dataset Augmentation in Web API Detection,
"Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality among time-critical diseases. Fast and accurate assessment of affected brain tissue is crucial for effective treatment planning. Decisions are often made under pressure by combining multi-modal data, including computed tomography perfusion (CTP) providing 4-dimensional (4D) data on cerebral hemodynamics. Stressful decision-making in a narrow time window can be managed with structured training and artificial intelligence-driven decision support tools. Synthetic CTP data can be used in stroke simulation tools for clinical training, protecting patient privacy and serving as augmented data for training a machine learning model in stroke classification and segmentation. Deep generative models, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs), are powerful tools for synthesizing medical images. This study investigates various GAN architectures to create high-resolution 4D CTP datasets, where among those models hierarchical amortized GAN successfully synthesized 4D CTP data with FID of 1.26. This demonstrates the ability to replicate brain structures and perfusion dynamics, although further refinements in temporal modeling are needed for clinical use.","Khanmohammadi, Mahdieh; Tomasetti, Luca; Hassan, Ahmed A.; Vier, Orjan; Christiansen, Carl H.; Engan, Kjersti; Kurz, Kathinka Daehli",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/DSP65409.2025.11074930,cm26i25uun,,,,"2025 25th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Digital Signal Processing (DSP), 2025 25th International Conference on",,5,1,,True,20250625,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Accuracy; Shape; Computed tomography; Computational modeling; Digital signal processing; Brain modeling; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Data models; Time factors",Stroke Simulation: Generative AI for Computed Tomography Perfusion Synthesis,
"ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) tools can modify nutritional management in clinical settings. These technologies, based on machine learning and deep learning, enable the identification of risks, the proposal of personalized interventions, and the monitoring of patient progress using data extracted from clinical records. ChatGPT excels in areas such as nutritional assessment by calculating caloric needs and suggesting nutrient-rich foods, and in diagnosis, by identifying nutritional issues with technical terminology. In interventions, it offers dietary and educational strategies but lacks critical abilities such as interpreting non-verbal cues or performing physical examinations. Recent studies indicate that ChatGPT achieves high accuracy in questions related to clinical guidelines but shows deficiencies in integrating multiple medical conditions or ensuring the accuracy of meal plans. Additionally, generated plans may exhibit significant caloric deviations and imbalances in micronutrients such as vitamin D and B12. Despite its limitations, this AI has the potential to complement clinical practice by improving accessibility and personalization in nutritional care. However, its effective implementation requires professional supervision, integration with existing healthcare systems, and constant updates to its databases.

"The exploitation of low-altitude (LA) airspace is advancing globally, boosting the sensing demands for heterogenous flying aircraft. To fulfill an accurate and intelligent sensing, the future 6G base station (BS) requires to aggregate features of multiple sensors’ views, then perform edge inference via loading the artificial intelligence (AI) model. However, this process confronts communication and computation bottlenecks owing to high-dimensional feature uploading as well as frequent memory access. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose a multi-task over-the-air edge inference system for LA airspace, where feature aggregation is efficiently achieved employing over-the-air computation, and multiple inference tasks arriving at the BS are processed in batches to reduce memory access. Under this arrangement, we formulate a joint batching and beamforming design problem to maximize the number of completed tasks, constrained by completion latency and inference accuracy requirements. To address this intractable problem, we first examine the case with synchronous task arrivals and single batch. A spatial correlation-aware beamforming design approach is proposed to effectively suppress feature aggregation error and ensure inference accuracy. Next, we delve into the general asynchronous task arrival case. An AI-generated online policy is developed, which innovatively utilizes diffusion model to output batching decisions, thereby adapting to the dynamic and uncertain nature of task arrivals. Simulation results obtained on real-world dataset corroborate the importance of capturing the spatial correlation among sensors. In addition, the proposed approach realizes outstanding performance compared to benchmark batching, beamforming, and learning methods, and the completed task amount is close to offline optimization with prior task information.","Fu, Y.; Qin, P.; Wang, Y.; Chen, L.; Li, M.; Zhao, X.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCOMM.2025.3563657,kvtxyrdhxn,,,10,"IEEE Transactions on Communications, Communications, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"Technologies of generative artificial intelligence (hereinafter referred to as GenAI) are becoming an integral part of society, taking part in various socio-cultural and socio-economic spheres, and therefore they actualise the problem of socio-cultural reproduction. Despite the active development of this research vector in terms of generative synthesis effects and risks, there is no detailed conceptualisation of transition processes between the current and predicted states. The purpose of the article is to reveal the essence of the process of forming socio-cultural distortions when interacting with the GenAI. The methodological basis is the actor-network theory. The study reveals the actor structure of interaction with the GenAI as part of the composition of social and generative actors and data array mediating their connection. It is argued that the resulting nature of socio-generative interaction is determined by the social predestination of the data array, which we propose to distinguish in four variants. Moreover, these variants set four types of relationship between the actors, and in the end, socio-cultural meaning-making occurs. The process of transition including the direct one (in which the information-objective result of social-generative interaction transfers to its socially subjective representation) and the revers one (in which the generative-subjective result transfers to its socially objective representation) are conceptualised. It is concluded that this process is a recursive cycle of distorting reproduction of the socio-cultural system. The results contribute to the conceptualisation of the phenomenon of the AI and its role in social systems, complement the discussion regarding the likely effects and risks for society and can serve as a basis for developing regulatory solutions in various areas of the GenAI use.",V.

"Digital Forensics (DF) encompasses the processes of collecting, analysing, and preserving digital evidence crucial for investigations involving cybercrime, security breaches and other criminal cases. The rising number of digital devices requiring investigation, coupled with diminishing confidence in the legal process due to the extensive time needed to process these devices, has prompted the development of a novel framework known as AGAFA. This framework, powered by Explainable AI, aims to meet the growing demand for digital forensic services. The primary objectives of this hybrid neuro-symbolic approach are to enhance the transparency of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in forensic analyses and to protect digital systems. Additionally, it leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract insights from vast datasets in a timely and cost-effective manner.

"Projects are essential for organizations, driving change and progress. Project reviews are crucial to avoid redundancy, prevent repeated mistakes, optimize resources, and foster innovation. Although various review methods exist (e.g., lessons learned), not all knowledge can be fully documented. Capturing knowledge is crucial for innovation, especially in product development. Hence capturing knowledge within the context of innovative product development even more critical. This paper proposes using Campbell's Hero Journey framework to harness generative AI for capturing project knowledge more effectively. This research includes an updated literature review on project reviews, knowledge sharing and creation, storytelling in project management, and the use of generative AI for storytelling.

"While the tools associated with Generative Artificial Intelligence have evolved over some years, they have become widely used and entered widespread public consciousness since 2022. Generative AI has an immediate impact on Higher Education because of its effect on many of the skills that students need to acquire. Immediate responses to the availability of Generative AI have focused on concerns about student cheating and about the need to design its inappropriate use out of assessments. While the discussion of how it affects learning and teaching has moved on to recognise that students do need to understand how Generative AI can be used there is still limited appreciation of where it fits into the teaching of research methods. Generative AI, used carefully and appropriately, can be applied as a research tool and as it evolves it is likely that new opportunities for its use will emerge. Research typically entails a measure of independent work and scholarly writing by students. Generative AI can create wording which, at least superficially, can appear to a reader as professional and fluent but which is often generic and superficial. For a student encountering the need to carry out research for the first time, typically as part of a taught degree course, it can be difficult to distinguish between the legitimate use of Generative AI, for example to assist with creating ideas, and its inappropriate use to produce text which does not reflect research which has been carried out. A useful starting point for discussing the application of Generative AI is to compare it with the involvement of another person. For a student to pretend that something is their own work when it is not, constitutes plagiarism whether the work in fact is produced by somebody else or it is produced by an AI engine. Conversely it would be reasonable to discuss concepts with another person and similarly to discuss them with AI. Framing this introduces some challenges around how to build AI into teaching about research.","Rich, Martin",Business Source Ultimate,,10.34190/ecrm.24.1.3643,fs5wkcidqz,,,,Proceedings of the European Conference on Research Methods for Business &amp; Management Studies,,113,107,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=fs5wkcidqz&recordId=fs5wkcidqz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,False,20250601,Academic Conferences International,"Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; College curriculum; Academic discourse; Teaching methods; Research methodology",Teaching Research Methods in a Changing World: Responding to Generative Artificial Intelligence.,
"Objective: The growing availability and sophistication of online generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, necessitates an exploration of their applications within the RANZCP Fellowship Training Program. This article examines how GenAI could be integrated into various areas, including trainee selection, workplace-based assessments, the Scholarly Project (SP), and the Psychotherapy Written Case (PWC). While GenAI offers benefits, trainees must understand that there are limitations on how these can be used with patient data. They should also be aware of the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the use of purpose-built medical scribe programs. For this paper, ChatGPT was employed to enhance language quality, without contributing to content generation. Conclusion: The accessibility and ease of use of GenAI present both opportunities and challenges. Given the limitations of AI detection software, the RANZCP will need to adapt to GenAI rather than attempt to regulate its use. Revisions to assessment methods, particularly those relying on written assignments, will be needed. As this is a rapidly evolving field, training programs should be continually updated to remain relevant.","Gill, Shane; Galletly OAM, Cherrie",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1177/10398562251344470,vbvxxh3len,,,4,Australasian Psychiatry,,692,689,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=vbvxxh3len&recordId=vbvxxh3len&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,Sage Publications Inc.,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; ChatGPT; Medical informatics; Disclosure; Psychiatry education; Task analysis; Ethical problems; Royal Australian &amp; New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,"'I, robot, can help you'.

"The rapid integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into educational environments raises both opportunities and concerns regarding assessment design, academic integrity, and quality assurance. While new generation AI tools offer new modes of interactivity, feedback, and content generation, their use in assessment remains insufficiently pedagogically framed and regulated. In this study, we propose a new framework for generative AI-supported assessment in higher education, structured around the needs and responsibilities of three key stakeholders (branches): instructors, students, and control authorities. The framework outlines how teaching staff can design adaptive and AI-informed tasks and provide feedback, how learners can engage with these tools transparently, and how institutional bodies can ensure accountability through compliance standards, policies, and audits. This three-branch multi-level model contributes to the emerging discourse on responsible AI adoption in higher education by offering a holistic approach for integrating AI-based systems into assessment practices while safeguarding academic values and quality.","Ilieva, Galina; Yankova, Tania; Ruseva, Margarita; Kabaivanov, Stanimir",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/info16060472,jtavailxdr,,,6,Information,,,472,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=jtavailxdr&recordId=jtavailxdr&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Educational technology; Education ethics; Multilevel models; Assessment of education; All Other Miscellaneous Schools and Instruction; Administration of Education Programs; Educational Support Services,A Framework for Generative AI-Driven Assessment in Higher Education.,16
"Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) bridges the cyberspace and the physical space, driving advancements in autonomous systems like the V ehicular E mbodied A I NET work (VEANET). VEANET integrates advanced AI capabilities into vehicular systems to enhance autonomous operations and decision-making. Embodied agents, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals, actively interacting with the physical world. Embodied Agent Twins (EATs) are digital models of these embodied agents, with various Embodied Agent AI Twins (EAATs) for intelligent applications in cyberspace. In VEANETs, EAATs act as in-vehicle AI assistants to perform diverse tasks supporting autonomous driving using generative AI models. Due to limited onboard computational resources, AVs offload EAATs to nearby RoadSide Units (RSUs). However, the mobility of AVs and limited RSU coverage necessitates dynamic migrations of EAATs, posing challenges in selecting suitable RSUs under information asymmetry. To address this, we construct a multi-dimensional contract theoretical model between AVs and alternative RSUs. Considering that AVs may exhibit irrational behavior, we utilize prospect theory instead of expected utility theory to model the actual utilities of AVs. Finally, we employ a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM)-based algorithm to identify the optimal contract designs, thus enhancing the efficiency of EAAT migrations. Numerical results demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed GDM-based scheme in facilitating EAAT migrations compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning methods.","Zhong, Y.; Kang, J.; Wen, J.; Ye, D.; Nie, J.; Niyato, D.; Gao, X.; Xie, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TMC.2025.3526230,ak7fjfxspj,,,5,"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans. on Mobile Comput.",,4588,4573,,True,20250501,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Signal Processing and Analysis; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Contracts; Real-time systems; Decision making; Vehicle dynamics; Solid modeling; Computational modeling; Adaptation models; Navigation; Diffusion models; Vehicular embodied <mark>AI</mark>; multi-dimensional contract theory; <mark>generative</mark> diffusion model; prospect theory",Generative Diffusion-Based Contract Design for Efficient AI Twin Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks,24

"Background: The integration of Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into healthcare is rapidly evolving, necessitating ethical preparedness among nursing students. GAI technologies present ethical challenges related to patient privacy, algorithmic bias, and informed consent, underscoring the need for structured AI ethics education in nursing curricula. This study aims to examine the impact of an ethics education program on nursing students' AI ethical awareness, moral sensitivity, attitudes, and intentions to use GAI in healthcare. Methods: A quasi experimental, pretest‒posttest study was conducted with 115 nursing students. The participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 57), which received a structured AI ethics education program, or a control group (n = 58), which did not receive the intervention. The validated scales measured AI ethical awareness, moral sensitivity, attitudes, and the intention to use AI before and after the intervention. Results: Compared with the control group, the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in AI ethical awareness (M = 57.28, SD = 22.28) (M = 47.43, SD = 24.04; p =.025, η² = 0.044). Moral sensitivity also showed a notable improvement in the intervention group (M = 74.33, SD = 29.93) compared with the control group (M = 60.26, SD = 22.52; p =.005, η² = 0.067). Compared with the control group, positive attitudes toward AI significantly increased postintervention (M = 39.46, SD = 11.51) (M = 23.21, SD = 11.72; p &lt;.001, η² = 0.332), indicating a strong effect of ethics education. Furthermore, the intention to use AI technology improved significantly in the intervention group (M = 12.46, SD = 3.55) compared with the control group (M = 10.24, SD = 3.15; p =.001, η² = 0.099). However, negative attitudes toward GAI did not significantly change postintervention. Conclusion: This study highlights the effectiveness of structured AI ethics education in enhancing ethical competencies among nursing students. Integrating such programs into nursing curricula is essential to prepare future nurses for ethical decision-making in AI-driven healthcare. These findings support the development of standardized ethics training modules to guide responsible AI use in clinical practice and inform future curriculum design.

"Generative AI and autonomous AI agents are reshaping both the legal employment relationship and the broader social contract between employers and employees. This contract reflects society’s shared expectations about what employers and employees owe each other, including how value is created and distributed and who has authority and accountability for various activities. Unlike prior waves of automation that primarily affected routine tasks, generative AI now touches high-wage, high-status “knowledge” work, altering how expertise is recognized, how decisions are made, and how relationships are formed at work. This paper examines the historical foundations of technological change and employment relations, highlighting how generative AI intensifies existing trends while also introducing new dynamics across six key domains: (1) the role of employee judgment and authority, (2) the value of employee expertise and human-created data, (3) appropriate organizational control and employee autonomy, (4) the nature of work relationships, particularly in the context of AI agents, (5) responsibility for reskilling and career development, and (6) worker collective power.

"The project is about dataset marketplace platform to help the users to manage, share and generate datasets. It is built up on the SQLite and FAISS to achieve robust data management and fast similarity comparison. Userdata and metadata of datasets, such as the file paths and descriptions, are kept inside the SQLite database. This actually helps you to search and download millions of data information. FAISS, on the other hand, is primarily used for the indexing of high-dimensional vectors and similarity detection [2]. It lets the platform storage and query vector embeddings from datasets in a performant way, which helps to source features such as duplicate detection and relevancy-based recommendations. This is especially beneficial for finding a dataset, which is similar to a user's own data, or to prevent uploading of redundant data. It also has capabilities to create synthetic data by statistical and GAN methods. This functionality can help users to complement their datasets with artificial samples which might be beneficial for training machine learning models or preserving privacy, so that there is no dependency on original data. In summary, the project is building a whole environment for dataset management, which includes uploading, searching, downloading, and creating datasets while keeping their integrity as well as user privacy.

"Using Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Business Development and Opportunities is a ground-breaking concept that is changing how businesses formulate their strategies and content, how they can improve existing decisions and/or foster new market initiatives. Marketing can be enhanced by the use of advanced model AI in generating more profound approaches that can be adopted in creating marketing material in order to take up a business a notch higher. Thus, this paper aims at proposing a new method that complements the use of GPT-4 and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) in generating good business content and synthetic data as compared to conventional approaches. The applied in this paper is a python-based methodology that comprises of data collection process which involves Kaggle datasets encompassing market trends, customer behavior, and competitors analysis. Specifically, web scraping and data augmentation are used in preprocessing with the help of BeautifulSoup, Scrapy as well as SMOTE to improve the quality and variability of the dataset. Feature engineering employs PCA and TF-IDF to select and transform the features for improving the decision boundary of the dataset and to obtain the textual patterns. The GPT-4 model is used for the generation of contextualised and business relevant text, which helps the VAEs in the creation of synthetic data that improves the models capability in data sparse situations and for various business scenarios. The procedure of fine-tuning of the parameters of the model to enhance accuracy and relevance of the AI generated outputs is known as Bayesian Optimization. The suggested approach performs better than the existing literature including better BLEU scores, cross-validation accuracy, and runs faster.

Therefore, the rule-based system is migrated to a generative model that integrates both algorithms of machine learning for effective enhancement of both understanding and generating. The primary issues with this development were about the conversational context, empathetic and coherent response, and the scalability of the system. All these were achieved through advanced prompt engineering, a set of rigorous evaluation metrics like BLEU score, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score besides continuous user feedback for refining the performance of this model. This paper discusses methodologies to overcome the challenges and implications for the future of AI and mental health care with an emphasis on embedding technological advancements within empathetic human-computer interaction. The findings point out this chatbot is effective in providing emotional support and how AI is changing its role to improve the services of mental health.","Gupta, Dev; Swami, Vinita; Shukla, Divyansh; Nimala, K.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICSES63760.2024.10910363,fxtmihzodj,,,,"2024 International Conference on Innovative Computing, Intelligent Communication and Smart Electrical Systems (ICSES), Innovative Computing, Intelligent Communication and Smart Electrical Systems (ICSES), 2024 International Conference on",,7,1,,True,20241212,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Measurement; Machine learning algorithms; Databases; Scalability; Refining; Mental health; Machine learning; Chatbots; Depression; Prompt engineering; Mental Health; Chathot; <mark>AI</mark>; NLP; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Machine Learning",Design and Implementation of an AI-Driven Mental Health Chatbot: A Generative AI Model,

"Accurate and interpretable solar power forecasting is critical for effectively integrating Photo-Voltaic (PV) systems into modern energy infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel two-stage hybrid framework that couples deep learning-based time series prediction with generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance forecast accuracy and model interpretability. At its core, the proposed SolarTrans model leverages a lightweight Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture tailored for short-term DC power prediction using multivariate inverter and weather data, including irradiance, ambient and module temperatures, and temporal features. Experiments conducted on publicly available datasets from two PV plants over 34 days demonstrate strong predictive performance. The SolarTrans model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0782 and 0.1544, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.1760 and 0.4424, and R2 scores of 0.9692 and 0.7956 on Plant 1 and Plant 2, respectively. On the combined dataset, the model yields an MAE of 0.1105, RMSE of 0.3189, and R2 of 0.8967. To address the interpretability challenge, we fine-tuned the Flan-T5 model on structured prompts derived from domain-informed templates and forecast outputs. The resulting explanation module achieves ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-Lsum scores of 0.7889, 0.7211, 0.7759, and 0.7771, respectively, along with a BLEU score of 0.6558, indicating high-fidelity generation of domain-relevant natural language explanations.","Siddiqa, Ayesha; Rana, Nadim; Khan, Wazir Zada; Jeribi, Fathe; Tahir, Ali",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1371/journal.pone.0331516,7pibubplqn,,,9,PLoS ONE,,22,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=7pibubplqn&recordId=7pibubplqn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250917,Public Library of Science,Language models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Standard deviations; Energy infrastructure; Transformer models; Deep learning,Explaining solar forecasts with generative AI: A two-stage framework combining transformers and LLMs.,20

"The pervasive integration of generative AI (GenAI) into higher education presents transformative opportunities alongside complex ethical challenges that necessitate urgent scholarly attention. This study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) following the rigorous Kitchenham protocol, analyzing 27 peer-reviewed articles published between 2023 and 2025 to comprehensively identify these ethical issues and map them against the ALT Framework for Ethical Learning Technologies (FELT). The SLR revealed seven prominent ethical concerns: (1) academic integrity and plagiarism, highlighting issues of unauthorized assistance and false authorship; (2) bias and fairness, manifested through algorithmic and linguistic biases; (3) data privacy and security, concerning unauthorized access and re-identification risks; (4) impact on critical thinking and learning outcomes, fostering over-reliance; (5) authorship, intellectual property, and copyright ambiguities; (6) misinformation, hallucinations, and deepfakes, eroding trust; and (7) broader environmental and labor impacts. Crucially, the mapping to FELT demonstrated that these issues collectively challenge institutional accountability, necessitate responsible learning paradigms, demand greater transparency in AI operations, and underscore the imperative for care towards individuals and societal well-being. Findings indicate a nascent and fragmented institutional response globally, driven by varied stakeholder perspectives. This research recommends a multi-faceted approach: fostering comprehensive AI literacy, adopting human-centered design, developing robust and adaptive policies, ensuring system transparency and accountability, strengthening data governance, advocating for ethical AI design, and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration. This study equips higher education stakeholders to navigate GenAI's ethical landscape and uphold core educational values by synthesizing current ethical dilemmas and offering a FELT-guided framework for responsible integration.

"This paper investigated the difference in the opinions of lecturers and students on the use of generative AI (GenAI) systems in teaching and learning a foreign language. The study also sought to establish the perception and attitude of the foreign language students toward using GenAI in learning the foreign language. The current study employed a quantitative research approach to evaluate the current sample of lecturers and students’ attitudes toward the implementation of Generative AI (GenAI) systems in teaching and learning foreign languages. The sample involved 45 lecturers and 493 postgraduate students in foreign languages from Saudi Arabia. The survey questionnaire contained items based on the UTAUT model, which includes 15 items, of which four are based on performance expectancy, four on effort expectancy, three on social influence, and four on facilitating conditions. The survey took the form of Google Forms shared on social media and email. The data collected was analysed using descriptive statistics, and t-test results were obtained to see the overall influence of two sets of behavioural perceptions of the two groups. A comparative analysis of the attitudes reveals that lecturers had a positive optimism with relative efforts and facilitating conditions needed for the adoption and integration of GenAI in FL education (Mean = 4.29, SD = 0.79, Variance = 0.81, t = 2.45, p= 0.015). On the other hand, the students showed positive acceptance, usage and application of GenAI models in facilitating their academic engagements in FL education (mean = 7.58, sd = 0.42, variance = 0.18, t = 12.75 p = 0.001).

"In Australia, almost 50 % of paramedics are female yet they remain under-represented in stereotypical depictions of the profession. The potentially transformative value of generative artificial intelligence (AI) may be limited by stereotypical errors, misrepresentations and bias. Increasing use of text-to-image generative AI, like DALL-E 3, could reinforce gender and ethnicity biases and, therefore, is important to objectively evaluate.In March 2024, DALL-E 3 was utilised via GPT-4 to generate a series of individual and group images of Australian paramedics, ambulance officers, police officers and firefighters. In total, 82 images were produced including 60 individual-character images, and 22 multiple-character group images. All 326 depicted characters were independently analysed by three reviewers for apparent gender, age, skin tone and ethnicity.Among first responders, 90.8 % (N = 296) were depicted as male, 90.5 % (N = 295) as Caucasian, 95.7 % (N = 312) as a light skin tone, and 94.8 % (N = 309) as under 55 years of age.

"An essential component of sustainable development is water quality management, which requires accurate monitoring and forecasting capabilities. Conventional methods for assessing water quality often face challenges such as sparse data, sensor inaccuracies, and real-time processing limitations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Smart IoT-Enabled Water Quality Management System that integrates Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SR-GAN) with artificial intelligence (AI) for enhanced monitoring and prediction. The system utilizes IoT -based smart sensors to collect real-time data on temperature, turbidity, oxygen concentration, pH levels, and other water quality parameters.SR-GAN enhances both the temporal and spatial resolution of low-quality sensor data, enabling better feature extraction and more precise information. Generative AI models are then employed for automated decision-making, anomaly detection, and forecasting, effectively identifying potential water pollution threats. Compared to conventional AI and deep learning methods, the proposed framework achieves superior performance in terms of response time efficiency (30% improvement), data quality, and prediction accuracy (98.7%).

"This paper explores how Generative AI can transform Design for Safety &amp; Reliability (DfSR) by proactively identifying and mitigating risks throughout the product development lifecycle. It examines three key approaches to leveraging generative AI in DfSR: Assistive Ai: This approach employs Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to interact dynamically with users. While highly flexible and agile, interpretability and control of AI-generated outputs remain areas of concern. Potential applications include providing diverse perspectives during brainstorming sessions. Scripted Ai: This approach uses predefined rules and scripts to automate repetitive tasks to improve the efficiency and consistency. However, its inflexibility limits its effectiveness in complex scenarios. We suggest using Scripted AI to automate routine tasks. Agentic Ai: This approach involves AI systems autonomously executing tasks, demonstrating a higher degree of “agency”. While offering real-time analysis and continuous learning capabilities, ethical considerations and system complexity present challenges. The paper highlights how these approaches can be applied across various stages of the DfSR workflow, from defining requirements and planning to risk assessment, design optimization, and sustainment. Each stage benefits from the unique strengths of each AI approach. We also emphasize the limitations of Generative AI tools.

"The fashion business is growing quickly and is one of the main forces behind the world's economies. The everexpanding business is driving a significant rise in the application of computer science to address various issues inside it. It becomes difficult to discover a personalized wardrobe that reflects their preferences, taste and needs. Traditional Fashion Recommendation Systems (FRSs) limits their ability to scale and adapt the ever growing styles as they heavily rely on manual design. Fashion can also be so inclusive, expressive and sustainable. Appropriate recommendations given by FRS helps to enhance user satisfaction and makes it more enjoyable and accessible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have revolutionized FRS enabling them to consume beyond conventional methods by taking in contextual data, user preferences and visual content for recommendations with a more individualized suggestion. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a potent technique to enhance these systems by generating diverse fashion designs with high fidelity. In this paper, a systematic review of parameters used to evaluate FRS using Generative Algorithms is discussed. Various parameters to evaluate system performance and the recommendation quality are analyzed. Detailed analysis of the input parameters, to be considered to design the efficient AI based FRS (AI-FRS) is also presented. Along with this, research gaps are explored by surveying numerous review papers. This review will help in deciding the evaluation parameters to develop and examine more efficient AI based FRS.","Bhoyar, Ketaki; Patil, Suvarna",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICAET63349.2025.10932201,c74tphenx5,,,,"2025 1st International Conference on AIML-Applications for Engineering &amp; Technology (ICAET), AIML-Applications for Engineering &amp; Technology (ICAET), 2025 1st International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250116,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Measurement; Visualization; Accuracy; System performance; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Sustainable development; Recommender systems; Business; Systematic literature review; System performance parameters; <mark>Generative</mark> Algorithms; <mark>Generative</mark> Adversarial Networks (GAN); <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> (<mark>AI</mark>); Performance metrics; Fashion Recommendation System (FRS)",Generative AI for Revolutionizing Personal Style,

"To enhance teaching practices and lecture strategies, online lecturers need reliable and opportunity feedback. Post-observation feedback provides opportunities for reflection, dialogue, development, and helping lecturers to improve their teaching practices. However, this poses a significant challenge in online higher education due to traditional observation procedures requiring previously trained observers, rendering them expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the observation process has human biases such as those introduced in annotated data by trained observers. Automated solutions powered by Artificial Intelligence offer a viable alternative providing consistency and affordability, delivering actionable feedback to lecturers, thereby helping to improve their pedagogical techniques and supporting student success. Hence, analyzing the video conferencing of the lecturers in online courses would help provide feedback to instructors and insights about teaching practices to institutional leadership. Therefore, this Work in Progress describes a proof of concept on a speech processing pipeline for providing post-observation feedback using Generative Artificial Intelligence to support the reflection process about online higher education teachers' practices.","Cheuquepan-Maldonado, Diego; Gonzalez-Ibanez, Roberto",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016321,h2puwd5laj,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,3,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Education; Pipelines; Semantics; Observers; Rendering (computer graphics); Reflection; Speech processing; Videoconferences; Speech to text; automated feedback; online education; teaching practices; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; video conferencing,Work-in-Progress: Facilitating Automated Feedback of Online Video Conferencing Through Generative Artificial Intelligence,

"As a passive behavior, intermittent discontinuance may lead to user defection and undermine the continuous development of generative artificial intelligence. From a cognition-affect-conation perspective, this research examined the enablers and inhibitors of generative AI user intermittent discontinuance. We adopted a mixed method of structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. The results indicated that privacy concern and information hallucination influence cognitive dissonance, which further leads to intermittent discontinuance. In contrast, perceived intelligence, anthropomorphism, and personalization influence affective commitment, which prevents intermittent discontinuance. The results imply that generative AI companies need to be concerned with both cognitive dissonance and affective commitment in order to prevent user intermittent discontinuance.","Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Chunlei",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/10447318.2024.2376370,bbvirdx5wf,,,10,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,,6387,6377,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=bbvirdx5wf&recordId=bbvirdx5wf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250515,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Cognitive dissonance; Passivity (Psychology); Structural equation modeling; Anthropomorphism,Examining Generative AI User Intermittent Discontinuance from a C-A-C Perspective.,41
"The reliance on deep learning models for sensor-based material classification amplifies the demand for labeled training data. However, acquiring large-scale, annotated spectral data for applications such as near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy in plastic sorting remains a significant challenge due to high acquisition costs and environmental variability. This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) in synthetic spectral data generation. Specifically, it examines whether LLMs have acquired sufficient implicit knowledge to assist in generating spectral data and introduce meaningful variations that enhance model performance when used for data augmentation. Classification accuracy is reported exclusively as a proxy for structural plausibility of the augmented spectra; maximizing augmentation performance itself is not the study's goal. From as little as one empirical mean spectrum per class, LLM-guided simulation produced data that enabled up to 86% accuracy, evidence that the generated variation preserves class-distinguishing information. While the approach performs best for spectral distinct polymers, overlapping classes remain challenging. Additionally, the transfer of optimized augmentation parameters to unseen classes indicates potential for generalization across material types. While plastic sorting serves as a case study, the methodology may be applicable to other domains such as agriculture or food quality assessment, where spectral data are limited. The study outlines a novel path toward scalable, AI-supported data augmentation in spectroscopy-based classification systems.","Kulko, Roman-David; Hanus, Andreas; Elser, Benedikt",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/s25134114,g3a4ag2qbb,,,13,Sensors (14248220),,,4114,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=g3a4ag2qbb&recordId=g3a4ag2qbb&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Data augmentation; Materials analysis; Near infrared spectroscopy; Recycling management; Deep learning; Materials science; Spectrum analysis; Other Waste Collection; Materials Recovery Facilities,Generative Artificial Intelligence for Synthetic Spectral Data Augmentation in Sensor-Based Plastic Recycling.,25

"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is emerging as a disruptive force, both economically and socially, with its use spanning from the provision of goods and services to everyday activities such as healthcare and household management. This study analyzes the enabling and inhibiting factors of GAI use in Spain based on a large-scale survey conducted by the Spanish Center for Sociological Research on the use and perception of artificial intelligence. The proposed model is based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and is fitted using machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, Random Forest extensions, and extreme gradient boosting. While decision trees allow for detailed visualization of how variables interact to explain usage, Random Forest provides an excellent model fit (R2 close to 95%) and predictive performance. The use of Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that knowledge about artificial intelligence, followed by innovation orientation, is the main explanatory variable of GAI use. Among sociodemographic variables, Generation X and Z stood out as the most relevant. It is also noteworthy that the perceived privacy risk does not show a clear inhibitory influence on usage. Factors representing the positive consequences of GAI, such as performance expectancy and social utility, exert a stronger influence than the negative impact of hindering factors such as perceived privacy or social risks.","Pérez-Portabella, Antonio; Andrés-Sánchez, Jorge de; Arias-Oliva, Mario; Souto-Romero, Mar",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/a18070410,i6lyizbfzj,,,7,Algorithms,,,410,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=i6lyizbfzj&recordId=i6lyizbfzj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Planned behavior theory; Innovation adoption; Machine learning; Prediction models; Sociological research; Spain; Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities,Integrating Machine Learning Techniques and the Theory of Planned Behavior to Assess the Drivers of and Barriers to the Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence: Evidence in Spain.,18
"The concept of Network-as-a-Service involves deploying and reconfiguring next-generation networks, in a flexible and dynamic manner, to always cater to the needs of the respective stakeholders. It presents a complex challenge to manage and orchestrate computational and telecommunication resources across the cloud-edge continuum, especially with the growing focus on cost efficiency and energy consumption. To address this complexity, several technology enablers are considered, but the recent advancements in Large Language Models research have inevitably brought Intent-Based Networking to the forefront. This paper explores the architecture and implementation of an intent-based automation framework that adheres to contemporary industry standards, while also considering sustainability. To achieve this, a translation pipeline is introduced, based on emerging multimodal Generative Artificial Intelligence models, which transforms a high-level description of desired network capabilities and supplementary deployment files into machine-consumable information digested by the network itself. Therefore, several state-of-the-art online and locally deployed models are compared. The ultimate motivation of this work is to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed framework, promoting sustainability through minimal resource consumption and cost efficiency. Additionally, the framework ensures compatibility with modern orchestrators and next-generation Operational Support System that follow the same industry standards.","Trantzas, Kostis; Brodimas, Dimitrios; Agko, Besiana; Tziavas, Georgios Christos; Tranoris, Christos; Denazis, Spyros; Birbas, Alexios",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1186/s13638-025-02472-x,waek3atbg5,,,1,EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications &amp; Networking,,17,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=waek3atbg5&recordId=waek3atbg5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250603,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language models; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Telecommunication; Employee motivation; Telecommunications Resellers; Other telecommunications; Communication Equipment Repair and Maintenance; All Other Telecommunications,Intent-driven network automation through sustainable multimodal generative AI.,2025

"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has recently emerged as a promising solution to address critical challenges of blockchain technology, including scalability, security, privacy, and interoperability. In this paper, we first introduce GAI techniques, outline their applications, and discuss existing solutions for integrating GAI into blockchains. Then, we discuss emerging solutions that demonstrate the effectiveness of GAI in addressing various challenges of blockchain, such as detecting unknown blockchain attacks and smart contract vulnerabilities, designing key secret sharing schemes, and enhancing privacy. Moreover, we present a case study to demonstrate that GAI, specifically the generative diffusion model, can be employed to optimize blockchain network performance metrics. Experimental results clearly show that, compared to a baseline traditional AI approach, the proposed generative diffusion model approach can converge faster, achieve higher rewards, and significantly improve the throughput and latency of the blockchain network. Additionally, we highlight future research directions for GAI in blockchain applications, including personalized GAI-enabled blockchains, GAI-blockchain synergy, and privacy and security considerations within blockchain ecosystems.","Nguyen, C.T.; Liu, Y.; Du, H.; Hoang, D.T.; Niyato, D.; Nguyen, D.N.; Mao, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MNET.2024.3412161,ayeyttgxtz,,,2,"IEEE Network, Network, IEEE",,241,232,,True,20250301,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Blockchains; Smart contracts; Security; Consensus protocol; Scalability; Privacy; Data privacy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Autoencoders; Large language models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Blockchain; Variational Autoencoder; <mark>Generative</mark> Adversarial Network; <mark>Generative</mark> Diffusion Model; Large Language Model","Generative AI-Enabled Blockchain Networks: Fundamentals, Applications, and Case Study",39
"ChatGPT, which rides on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has garnered exponential attention worldwide since its release in 2022. While there is an increasing number of studies probing into the potential benefits and challenges of ChatGPT in education, most of them confine the focus to informal learning and higher education. The formal adoption of ChatGPT in authentic classroom settings, especially in K-12 contexts, remains underexplored. In view of this gap, we conducted a quasi-experiment to study the effects of integrating ChatGPT into a compulsory Grade-10 English as a foreign language (EFL) writing course in a Hong Kong secondary school. The participants (99 Grade-10 students) were divided into treatment or control groups; the former and latter respectively used ChatGPT and conventional media as the tool for EFL writing instruction. The analysis of the participants' EFL writing performance at the end of the experiment shows that the treatment group outperformed the control group. Further, there was a significant interaction effect between the assigned group of participants and their baseline level of EFL proficiency. Compared to the high-achieving participants, low-achieving ones tended to benefit more from ChatGPT-supported EFL writing instruction in the experiment. These findings together suggest that ChatGPT has the potential to be applied in formal EFL writing instruction in K-12 classroom settings.","Leisi Pei; Siu-Yung Jong, Morris; Biyun Huang; Wai-Chung Pang; Junjie Shang",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.30191/ETS.202507_28(3).TP05,fymtzsaebn,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,297,281,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=fymtzsaebn&recordId=fymtzsaebn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,International Forum of Educational Technology &amp; Society (IFETS),<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Foreign language education; ChatGPT; English as a foreign language; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language Schools,Formally integrating Generative AI into secondary education: Application of ChatGPT in EFL writing instruction.,28
"(1) Background: In the era of generative AI (GenAI), assessing AI literacy is essential for understanding how effectively non-expert users can interact with AI. However, existing assessment tools primarily focus on users' understanding of AI principles or rely on self-reported scales, neglecting critical thinking and actual interaction capabilities. To address this gap, this study aims to design and validate evaluation indicators targeting the behavioral process of human–GenAI interactions and analyze the impact of critical thinking. (2) Methods: Grounded in information literacy and critical thinking frameworks, this study operationalized human–AI interaction capabilities into behavioral indicators and rubrics through observation, surveys, and pilot studies. Data were collected from 121 undergraduates completing two real-world tasks with GenAI, and their interaction processes were documented and evaluated. (3) Results: The indicators showed acceptable inter-rater and internal consistency reliability. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed a three-dimensional structure. Further analysis showed that interaction capabilities varied across gender, academic background, AIGC use frequency, critical thinking disposition levels, and question chain logic. (4) Conclusions: The developed evaluation indicators are reliable and valid. Further analysis reveals that a high critical thinking disposition can offset the disadvantage of lower usage frequency. This highlights the significance of critical thinking in enhancing human–GenAI interaction capabilities.","Li, Feiming; Yan, Xinyu; Su, Hongli; Shen, Rong; Mao, Gang",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/jintelligence13060062,lfjuj76vi5,,,6,Journal of <mark>Intelligence</mark>,,,62,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=lfjuj76vi5&recordId=lfjuj76vi5&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250601,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Confirmatory factor analysis; Exploratory factor analysis; Critical thinking; Critical literacy,An Assessment of Human–AI Interaction Capability in the Generative AI Era: The Influence of Critical Thinking.,13
"This study investigates the role of ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence tool, in enhancing learning within computer science and engineering education. Conducted during the Fall 2023 semester, the work utilized ChatGPT based on the GPT-3.5 model to assess its effectiveness across three educational domains: programming, analytical problem-solving, and hardware-related system design. A structured methodology was implemented wherein students from multiple academic levels attempted tasks independently and then used ChatGPT for support. Their interactions and reflections were systematically recorded and analyzed to evaluate the model’s utility and limitations in an educational setting. Results indicated that ChatGPT was particularly effective in programming tasks, where it could generate accurate code and useful explanations. However, its performance declined in more complex areas such as artificial intelligence and computer architecture, where deeper analytical reasoning and domain-specific expertise were required. The study further highlights the value of training students in prompt engineering, which significantly improved their ability to formulate targeted queries, increased metacognitive awareness, and helped calibrate their trust in the tool’s responses. Recommendations include future integration of graphical diagram support to aid comprehension in visually complex subjects, such as system design and architecture. Key challenges identified include limited transparency in training data, the lack of visual support, and the need to assess whether prompt engineering skills and improved AI usage persist and transfer across courses. While newer reasoning-oriented models such as GPT-4, Claude 3, and DeepSeek may offer enhanced capabilities, these were not available during the Fall 2023 study period and are suggested for future evaluation. The study also calls for future research using these newer, more advanced large language models to reassess findings and ensure continued relevance as these tools evolve. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the educational application of generative AI and informs future strategies for integrating AI tools into engineering pedagogy.","Waqas, Maria; Hasan, Shehzad; Ali, Anita",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s40593-025-00525-2,dqtm4oh3cr,,,,International Journal of <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark> in Education: Official Journal of the International AIED Society,,32,1,,True,20251023,Springer New York,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; ChatGPT; Large language models; Computer science; Computer systems engineering; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>,Effectiveness of Generative AI Tools in Computer Science and Engineering Education,
"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is fundamentally transforming notions of creativity and creative production across disciplines, yet a comprehensive understanding of professional attitudes and integration patterns remains challenging. This scoping review examines how creative professionals perceive and integrate GenAI technologies across four domains: visual art and design, writing and literature, performing arts, and environmental and spatial design. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we analysed 57 papers (2022–2025) from multiple databases, focusing mainly on empirically based studies of professional creative practice. We identify universal trends, including the shift from creation to curation and meta-creation, the emergence of new literacies (prompt engineering, AI evaluation), and the reconfiguration of expertise hierarchies. Career stage emerges as a critical factor: across domains, entry-level professionals demonstrate enthusiasm and view GenAI as a natural extension of digital tools, while senior practitioners express scepticism about expertise devaluation. All fields consistently position GenAI in early-stage conceptualisation rather than final production, developing hybrid methodologies that preserve human judgment in convergent creative phases. However, impacts manifest differently based on each field/ sub-field’s relationship to embodiment and materiality. Integration levels follow an inverse relationship with traditional notions of “pure” creativity—fields prioritising embodied practice and cultural authenticity (fine arts, literary fiction, classical music) show the most significant resistance. At the same time, commercially oriented domains embrace higher adoption for efficiency gains. Visual artists face “erasure by obscurity” from AI output volume; writers negotiate between nonlinear, associative language generation and AI’s tendency toward coherence and cliché; performers uniquely embrace computational unpredictability as a generative force; architects balance efficiency imperatives with concerns about cultural homogenisation effects of Western-centric AI systems. Our conceptual framework positions creative professionals’ attitudes along two dimensions: knowledge codifiability (tacit/embodied to explicit/codifiable) and output materiality (physical/permanent to digital/ephemeral). Key tensions include balancing productivity with meaningful engagement, volume with distinction, precision with serendipity, and individual with collective intelligence. Ultimately, our findings reveal complex patterns of ambivalence shaped by competing value systems. This review contributes a comprehensive mapping of GenAI applications across creative disciplines, potential disconnects between educational emphasis on critique and industry’s pragmatic adoption, and gaps for future research on longitudinal skill impacts, emerging AI-native practices, Global South perspectives, and forms of creative resistance.","Tsao, Jack; Liang, Cindy Xinyi; Nogues, Collier; Wong, Alice",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s00146-025-02667-2,rg57d6zjwn,,,,"<mark>AI</mark> &amp; SOCIETY: Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Communication",,20,1,,False,20251008,Springer London,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (GenAI); Creative practice; Human-<mark>AI</mark> collaboration; Scoping review; Creative industries,Perceptions and integration of generative artificial intelligence in creative practices and industries: a scoping review and conceptual model,
"Predicting financial markets remains essential for decision-making in trading and investment. However, traditional models often fall short due to low-quality data, market volatility, and the complexity of global economic trends. Generative AI offers a transformative approach by improving data management processes, enhancing prediction accuracy, and overcoming the limitations of current forecasting models. This research explores the potential of Generative AI to enrich financial data through techniques like data augmentation, synthetic data generation, and anomaly detection. Specifically, the study investigates how integrating Generative AI into data preprocessing can enhance predictive modeling using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting, particularly in stock prices. The research also explores feature engineering techniques such as moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and volatility metrics, which are crucial for capturing market trends. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are employed to create additional realistic trading scenarios, boosting model robustness. Implemented using Python, the findings reveal that the combined LSTM and GAN model improved prediction accuracy over traditional methods, achieving an RMSE of 0.096 and R-squared ($\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{2}}$) $\mathbf{0. 8 5}$ in stock price forecasts. The incorporation of synthetic data with traditional financial metrics leads to an improvement in the model's ability to predict short-term market trends. These findings suggest that the use of Generative AI can provide a more resilient and adaptive approach to financial market prediction, opening new avenues for research in the domain. Future research could focus on expanding the scope to include multi-market scenarios and incorporating real-time data streams.","Shivalini, M.

"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving significant breakthroughs in computer vision and image processing. However, there are still many challenges in rendering complex scenes, particularly generating and controlling images for extreme weather conditions. In this work, we propose a novel generative model based on ControlNet and achieve precise control and high-quality rendering of extreme weather features by combining a sparsely connected Squeeze-and-Excitation module with a zero-convolution design. The proposed model excels in generating highly realistic extreme weather scenes, including heavy rain and snow, while significantly enhancing the ability to fine-tune weather characteristic parameters. Experimental results validate the model's exceptional generation quality and robust control stability, which not only realistically reproduces complex weather scenes but also allows flexible adjustments to weather characteristics such as rainfall intensity, snowflake density, and flame range. Compared to previous methods, the model demonstrates substantial improvements in image detail fidelity, weather feature consistency and generation efficiency.

Also, summarizing the textual content of such papers continues to be a manual process and adds inefficiency and potential errors in information gathering. Finally, an integrated approach to the automation of both text extraction and summarization based on improved OCR and Google Gemini's generative AI technique is presented in this paper. By using more precise OCR algorithms, the system greatly increases accurate text recognition from poorly quality scans or complex structures.

"6G networks are envisioned to enable a wide range of applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart cities. However, this rapid expansion of network topologies makes the management of 6G wireless networks more complex and leads to performance degradation. Even though state-of-the-art applications on network services are providing promising results, they also risk disrupting the network’s performance. To overcome this, the services have to leverage what-if implementations covering a variety of scenarios. At this point, traditional simulations fall short of encompassing the dynamism and complexity of a physical network. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Generative AI-based Digital Twins. For this, we derive an optimization formula to differentiate different network scenarios by considering the specific key performance indicators (KPIs) for wireless networks. Then, we fed this formula to the generative AI with the historical twins and real-time twins to start generating the desired topologies. To evaluate the performance, we implement network and smart-city-oriented services, namely massive connectivity, tiny instant communication, right-time synchronization, and truck path routes. The simulation results reveal that our approach can achieve 38% more stable network throughput in high device density scenarios. Furthermore, the generated scenario accuracy is able to reach up to 98% level, surpassing the baselines.","Duran, Kubra; Cakir, Lal Verda; Ozdem, Mehmet; Gursu, Kerem; Canberk, Berk",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/GCWkshp64532.2024.11101058,ztnmvs2kx5,,,,"2024 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps), Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps), 2024 IEEE",,6,1,,True,20241208,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Signal Processing and Analysis; 6G mobile communication; Accuracy; Smart cities; Network topology; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Wireless networks; Throughput; Real-time systems; Digital twins; Synchronization; digital twin; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; 6g; smart city",Generative AI-enabled Digital Twins for 6G-enhanced Smart Cities,
"The continuous evolution of future mobile communication systems is heading towards the integration of communication and computing, with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) emerging as a crucial means of implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) computation. MEC could enhance the computational performance of wireless edge networks by offloading computing-intensive tasks to MEC servers. However, in edge computing scenarios, the sparse sample problem may lead to high costs of time-consuming model training. This paper proposes an MEC offloading decision and resource allocation solution that combines generative AI and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for the communication-computing integration scenario in the 802.11ax Wi-Fi network. Initially, the optimal offloading policy is determined by the joint use of the Generative Diffusion Model (GDM) and the Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) algorithm. Subsequently, resource allocation is accomplished by using the Hungarian algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the introduction of Generative AI significantly reduces model training costs, and the proposed solution exhibits significant reductions in system task processing latency and total energy consumption costs.","Du, Xinyang; Fang, Xuming",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/GLOBECOM52923.2024.10901620,4bg7pyupaz,,,,"GLOBECOM 2024 - 2024 IEEE Global Communications Conference, Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2024 - 2024 IEEE",,2014,2009,,True,20241208,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Costs; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Computational modeling; Simulation; Quality of service; IEEE 802.11ax Standard; Resource management; Wireless fidelity; Tuning; mobile edge computing; reinforcement learning; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; computing-communication integration; offloading decision",An Integrated Communication and Computing Scheme for Wi-Fi Networks based on Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning,
"The automation of fruit picking using robotic systems is rapidly advancing within precision agriculture, relying heavily on the accurate detection and segmentation of fruit objects through computer vision. This study explores the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create extensive fruit image datasets, concentrating on cherries, bananas, oranges, apples, and pineapples. Five generative models—Stable Diffusion v1.4, Stable Diffusion v1.5, Stable Diffusion v2, Stable Diffusion XL Refiner 1.0, and SDXL Turbo—were employed to generate 1000 images per fruit type, each set against a white background. Thresholding techniques were used to automatically extract fruit boundaries, which were then utilized to train segmentation models. The performance of these models was evaluated based on their accuracy and processing speed. SDXL Turbo consistently delivered the highest accuracy across all fruit types, though it required more processing time per image. Stable Diffusion XL Refiner 1.0 also exhibited strong accuracy but balanced performance differently. In contrast, Stable Diffusion v2 showed significant shortcomings, particularly in producing accurate images for cherries and oranges. This comparative analysis highlights the potential of advanced generative models in enhancing synthetic dataset creation for fruit object detection and segmentation in agricultural robotics. Future research will focus on refining these models to improve accuracy, broaden their applicability to a wider variety of fruits and environments, and optimize the trade-off between image quality and generation speed to meet the practical needs of agricultural automation.","Zhao, Kun; Nguyen, Minh; Yan, Weiqi",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/IVCNZ64857.2024.10794462,ubtog7yi2b,,,,"2024 39th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ), Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ), 2024 39th International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20241204,IEEE,Computing and Processing; Photonics and Electrooptics; Signal Processing and Analysis; Precision agriculture; Image quality; Image segmentation; Accuracy; Automation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Image synthesis; Refining; Object detection; Synthetic data; fruit detection; object segmentation; <mark>generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; synthetic dataset; Stable Diffusion; agricultural robotics; image processing; computer vision; automation,Evaluating Accuracy and Efficiency of Fruit Image Generation Using Generative AI Diffusion Models for Agricultural Robotics,
"This conceptualisation involves developing an online application software that incorporates generative AI in providing counselling information on career based on the users' interests, skills and expectations. Face to face counselling on the other hand has its constraints in terms of scale and accessibility but this form of career counseling by use of the present artificial intelligence also aspires to break barriers and provide a leveling ground for all students. This information includes the grade level, expected career, academic interests, skills, and hobbies users offer. The AI provides and explains several occupations, good as well as specific ones, which enables students to consider more jobs. It also provides the best colleges available, required degrees, expected income and future scope. When career awareness has been limited to competitive fields, the application enables students to think pragmatically about the options available to them. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based user interface enables the input of several attributes by students and reception of associated AI career suggestions. The inputs are then passed through a generative AI API running on a Node server to improve the usability of the response.

"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become central for the perception functions of autonomous vehicles, substantially enhancing their ability to understand and interpret the environment. However, these systems exhibit inherent limitations such as brittleness, opacity, and unpredictable behavior in out-of-distribution scenarios. The European Union (EU) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, as a pioneering legislative framework, aims to address these challenges by establishing stringent norms and standards for AI systems, including those used in autonomous driving (AD), which are categorized as high-risk AI. In this work, we explore how the newly available generative AI models can potentially support addressing upcoming regulatory requirements in AD perception, particularly with respect to safety. This short review paper summarizes the requirements arising from the EU AI Act regarding DNN-based perception systems and systematically categorizes existing generative AI applications in AD. While generative AI models show promise in addressing some of the EU AI Act's requirements, such as transparency and robustness, this review examines their potential benefits and discusses how developers could leverage these methods to enhance compliance with the Act.

"Grading and feedback provision for students’ open-ended responses are time-consuming and cognitively demanding. Despite the advocacy to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate assessment, concerns persist regarding inaccurate AI assessment on student learning and the potential detrimental effects on educators’ assessment practices due to reliance. One alternative is to leverage AI-powered assessment insights as auxiliary information to support educators’ assessment instead of solely entrusting AI for assessment. However, insights published in existing literature typically required excessive cognitive efforts from human graders to interpret and make use of. Generative AI (GenAI) technologies’ capability To produce natural-language assessment explanations could potentially tackle this challenge. To empirically examine the efficacy of such natural-language insights while accounting for concerns in over-reliance on AI, we invited 60 human graders from diverse backgrounds to participate in multiple phases of assessment for secondary students’ short-answer responses. Participants were assigned to one of the three conditions: no AI-powered assessment support; important-word highlights from AI-powered graders as support; and natural-language grading explanations from GenAI-powered graders as support. Mixed-effect regression analyses were adopted to examine the impacts of different AI-powered assessment insights on human assessment practices both in current assessment with AI-powered insights presented and in later assessment without AI-powered insights. Our findings indicate that GenAI-enabled natural-language insights significantly improved educators’ feedback quality compared to educators without AI support (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$\beta =0.190$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$p=0.010$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$\beta =0.556$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$p=0.093$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$\beta =-0.060$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$p=0.848$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$p&lt;0.05$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$r \in [0.352, 0.490]$$\end{document}, \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$\beta =0.190$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$p=0.010$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$\beta =0.556$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$p=0.093$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$\beta =-0.060$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$p=0.848$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$p&lt;0.05$$\end{document} \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$r \in [0.352, 0.490]$$\end{document}).

"The emergence and consecutive entrance of Generative AI (particularly ChatGPT) into the mainstream has provoked all kinds of reactions, from excitement to apprehension, but it has not been definitely decided whether it is a boon or a bane yet. We wish to voice the still unmentioned relation between AI accessibility and social injustice. So far, the initial access to tools such as ChatGPT has been free or low-cost. This is predicated on the availability of open-source or inexpensively sourced data. As the value of models hinges upon high quality, diverse data, the demand for it will increase, resulting in the rising costs of its procuration. We worry that the free models will then turn into expensive commodities, limiting their use only to the privileged entities.

"Trusted large language models (LLMs) inherit ethical guidelines to prevent generating harmful content, whereas malicious LLMs are engineered to enable the generation of unethical and toxic responses. Both trusted and malicious LLMs use guardrails in differential contexts per the requirements of the developers and attackers, respectively. We explore the multifaceted world of guardrails implementation in LLMs by conducting an empirical analysis to assess the effectiveness of guardrails using prompts. Our results revealed that guardrails deployed in the trusted LLMs could be bypassed using prompt manipulation techniques such as “pretend” and “persist” to generate harmful content. In addition, we also discovered that malicious LLMs still deploy weak guardrails to evade detection by generating human-like content. This empirical analysis provides insights into the design of the malicious and trusted LLMs. We also propose recommendations to defend against prompt manipulation and guardrails bypass while designing LLMs.","Sood, A.K.; Zeadally, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/MTS.2025.3582667,udcwndaqvv,,,3,"IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, Technology and Society Magazine, IEEE, IEEE Technol.

"This study investigated the impact of generative AI-assisted writing feedback, specifically using Grammarly, on English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners' writing proficiency, revision practices, and writing quality. Sixty postgraduate EFL students were randomly assigned to either an experimental group using Grammarly as an AI-enhanced feedback system or a control group receiving traditional instruction. Pre- and post-tests assessed overall writing proficiency, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 students from the experimental group to gather qualitative data. Quantitative results indicated that the experimental group achieved significantly higher post-test scores than the control group. Additionally, positive correlations were found between the use of AI features, including generative AI, grammar, and vocabulary tools, and increased revision frequency, as well as improvements in content, organization, and cohesion. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data revealed that AI-assisted feedback promoted student engagement by reducing frustration, boosting confidence, and facilitating a greater sense of accomplishment. Participants emphasized the need to strategically integrate AI tools with traditional instruction, to foster critical thinking, and for AI tools to prioritize natural language fluency as well as to provide detailed feedback beyond basic grammar and mechanics. These results suggest that generative AI-assisted writing feedback, when used with pedagogical awareness, can effectively enhance EFL learners' writing skills and support active participation in the writing process. The study also highlights that critical thinking skills are essential and that students should avoid overreliance on AI tools.",Mohamed Mekheimer,ERIC,,10.1007/s44217-025-00602-7,l2xmvldnnz,,,,Discover Education,,,,,True,20251201,,English (Second Language); Second Language Learning; Second Language Instruction; Computer Software; Language Tests; Comparative Analysis; Graduate Students; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Writing Evaluation; Writing Instruction; Revision (Written Composition); Student Attitudes; Correlation; Feedback (Response); Technology Integration; Critical Thinking; Learner Engagement; Instructional Effectiveness; Scores,"Generative AI-Assisted Feedback and EFL Writing: A Study on Proficiency, Revision Frequency and Writing Quality",4

"This study explores university educators’ attitudes, barriers, and learning needs regarding the adoption of generative AI in higher education. Using a mixed-methods approach, surveys from 70 educators and interviews with five programme directors at a university in the Netherlands reveal generally positive attitudes, especially towards content creation and personalised learning. However, actual use remains limited due to concerns about the reliability and ethics of AI-generated content, lack of pedagogical strategies, and insufficient training. Educators identified the need for professional development focused on evaluating AI outputs, addressing ethical concerns, and building adaptive expertise. These findings inform the design of university-level training programmes that prioritise transferable competencies such as digital (AI) literacy and critical thinking. The study also underscores the need for institutional support structures to enable responsible, effective generative AI use.

"In the era of Society 5.0, the integration of generative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) into the education system is very important to achieve sustainable learning outcomes. This educational paradigm aims to harness the potential of AI in creating a learning environment that is adaptive and responsive to the needs of individual students. By using generative technology, educators can develop more interactive and personalized teaching materials, and provide faster and more accurate feedback. Qualitative research methods will be used to gain an in-depth understanding of the experiences, perceptions, and challenges faced by educators and learners in this integration process. The subjects of the study will consist of: 1). Educators who use AI technology in teaching. 2). Students involved in AI-based learning. 3). Educational institution managers who implement policies related to the use of generative technology. The research will be conducted at SMA Gloria, one of them, and several educational institutions that have implemented AI technology in their curriculum, both at elementary, middle, and high levels. Data collection techniques using semi-structured interviews will be carried out with educators and students to explore their experiences related to the use of AI technology in the teaching and learning process. In addition, the application of AI in education also allows big data analysis to understand student learning patterns and identify areas that require more attention. With the results of this approach, it is hoped that the learning process will not only be more efficient but also more inclusive, so that all students can reach their maximum potential.

"This study reviews existing literature on generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its accessibility for students with visual, hearing, and motor disabilities in higher education. The objective is to identify gaps in the implementation of inclusive education practices. The PRISMA protocol guided the review process, and the Scopus and Web of Science databases were selected for their recognized academic rigor and comprehensive coverage. The first phase involved the review of 54 articles in English from 2023 to 2024. The selection process involved prioritizing articles based on empirical scientific studies on AI applications for students with disabilities, and discarding articles that did not meet the criteria. Ultimately, only five articles were selected. The findings reveal a significant research gap regarding the role of generative AI in supporting these students. Notably, the selected articles tend to focus more on sensory disabilities than on motor disabilities. This study is pioneering in pointing out the lack of research on motor disabilities during the analyzed period, a key aspect of AI in higher education.

"Although generative conversational artificial intelligence (AI) can answer questions well and hold conversations as a person, the semantic ambiguity inherent in text-based communication poses challenges to effective use. Effective use reflects the users’ utilization of generative conversational AI to achieve their goals, which has not been previously studied. Drawing on the media naturalness theory, we examined how generative conversational AI’s content and style naturalness affect effective use. A two-wave survey was conducted to collect data from 565 users of generative conversational AI. Two techniques were used in this study. Initially, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied to determine the variables that significantly affected the mechanisms (i.e., cognitive effort and communication ambiguity) and effective use. Secondly, an artificial neural network model was used to evaluate the relative importance of the significant predictors of mechanisms and effective use identified from the PLS-SEM analysis. The results revealed that the naturalness of content and style differed in their effects on cognitive effort and communication ambiguity. Additionally, cognitive effort and communication ambiguity negatively affected effective use. This study advances the literature on effective use by uncovering the psychological mechanisms underlying effective use and their antecedents.

"This paper investigates the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in financial forecasting and fraud detection, using a review approach to combine previous research and actual applications. Generative AI, which includes models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures like GPT, is a paradigm shift in data-driven decision-making. The assessment emphasizes GenAI's advantages over traditional financial models, specifically its capacity to generate realistic synthetic data, find complicated patterns, and adapt to changing trends. GenAI plays an important role in fraud detection by simulating adversarial behaviors and improving anomaly detection systems. This paper highlights GenAI's ability to solve the constraints of traditional models, such as static rule-based systems and linear forecasting methodologies, and presents a thorough framework for incorporating generative AI solutions into financial operations.

"Integrating generative AI and data engineering greatly enhances intelligent systems by addressing scalability, effectiveness, and real-time efficiency issues. Data engineering establishes the foundation to handle large and complex datasets, while generative AI streamlines these processes by automating repetitive tasks, detecting anomalies, and optimizing query performance. This paper discusses the essential concepts of data pipelines, including modularity, scalability, and automation, which are necessary to support large-scale data environments. Key components of a data pipeline, such as data sources, data flows, processing, and monitoring, are examined to enhance the data preparation process for analysis. This research contributes to the growing evidence showing how generative AI transforms data workflow optimization, particularly for machine learning (ML) pipelines and natural language processing (NLP).

"Generative AI models have transformed content creation by enabling high-quality image and data synthesis. However, these models often inherit and amplify societal biases present in their training datasets, leading to concerns about fairness in their applications. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a comprehensive framework for identifying, measuring and reducing bias in generative AI systems. The framework uses data reweighting, fairness-constrained training, and post-processing to enhance fairness across demographics like age, gender, and ethnicity. Using the FFHQ dataset, the framework demonstrates substantial improvements in fairness metrics, with demographic parity improving from 0.42 to 0.15 and equalized odds from 0.35 to 0.12, while maintaining competitive image quality, as indicated by a slight increase in FID from 7.21 to 8.12. Qualitative analysis confirms the generated outputs closely align with ideal demographics, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in addressing fairness without sacrificing performance, thus offering a practical solution for socially responsible AI development.","Bhardwaj, Nimit; Bhardwaj, Anvit; Garg, Lavanya",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICICACS65178.2025.10967861,ygxvlvhrhz,,,,"2025 3rd International Conference on Integrated Circuits and Communication Systems (ICICACS), Integrated Circuits and Communication Systems (ICICACS), 2025 3rd International Conference on",,8,1,,True,20250221,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Image quality; Measurement; Ethics; Ethnicity; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Image synthesis; Prevention and mitigation; Data models; Integrated circuit modeling; Bias Mitigation; Fairness; De-mographic Parity; Equalized Odds; Image Synthesis; StyleGAN2; FFHQ Dataset; Ethical <mark>AI</mark>; Data Reweighting",Controlling Bias in Generative AI: Techniques for Fair and Equitable Data Generation in Socially Sensitive Applications,

"The rapid evolution of network technologies and frequent network intrusions have amplified the demand for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) powered by artificial intelligence (AI). However, the performance of IDSs is limited by labeled intrusion data and class imbalances in existing datasets. Collecting such data through live network simulations is costly, insecure, and poses regulatory challenges. This paper presents a multi-model framework that uses a conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) to synthesize realistic network intrusion data. The framework addresses challenges such as unstable training, mode collapse, and handling mixed data types, which are common in most generative AI models when applied to non-Gaussian tabular data generation while validating the synthesized data through qualitative and quantitative analyses. Overlaid density histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) are used for qualitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, the train-real-test-synthetic (TRTS) and train-synthetic-test-real (TSTR) methods, as well as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, are utilized. The TRTS and TSTR methods are classifier-based approaches with classification accuracies of 98.36% and 97.95%, respectively, and are used to assess the synthesized intrusion data to ensure the interchangeability of the synthesized intrusion data and real-world intrusion data for training IDSs. The KS test results indicate a similarity score of 0.92 between real and synthesized data. Additionally, to provide interpretable insights into the performance of the model and refrain from using real-world intrusion data for analysis purposes, the framework employs an explainable AI (XAI) approach called local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME), enabling network security analysts to interpret features that influence the intrusive nature of the synthesized network intrusion data while preserving data privacy.","Rathakrishnan, Mathushaharan; Gayan, Samiru; Edirisinghe, Sampath; Inaltekin, Hazer",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICARC64760.2025.10963129,eqg6mpqruv,,,,"2025 5th International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC), Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC), 2025 5th International Conference on",,6,1,,True,20250219,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Analytical models; Histograms; Statistical analysis; Explainable <mark>AI</mark>; Scalability; Intrusion detection; Network security; Data models; Network intrusion; Intrusion detection systems; <mark>generative</mark> adversarial networks; multi-model framework; explainable <mark>AI</mark>; data privacy",A Multi-Model Framework for Synthesizing High-Fidelity Network Intrusion Data Using Generative AI,
"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus, causing progressive retinal damage and, if left untreated, leading to permanent blindness. Early detection is critical for effective treatment; however, the current manual diagnostic process performed by ophthalmologists is both time-intensive and reliant on highly trained professionals. This approach faces numerous challenges, including its inefficiency in detecting early-stage DR and the growing global prevalence of the disease. To address these limitations, the adoption of automated, efficient, and accurate detection methods is imperative. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) algorithms have significantly improved the performance of commercial DR detection systems, enabling more precise diagnoses. This study examines the challenges associated with traditional DR detection and classification, particularly in the early stages, and explores the transformative potential of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). By leveraging technologies like chat generative pre-trained transformers (e.g., ChatGPT), GAI can enhance clinical workflows by generating detailed medical reports, educating patients, and analyzing extensive datasets to uncover actionable insights.

"In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), native generative AI (GenAI) has become prominent in generating intelligent cyber-attacks in a smart grid environment by imitating operational parameters and metrics. As a result, it is imperative to understand the attack generation capabilities of native GenAI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Autoencoders in a smart grid environment. This research aims to explore the potential of GenAI models to accurately imitate and analyze the behavior of cyberattacks within a smart grid environment. The goal is to understand the risks posed by these intelligent attacks while developing strategies to protect against disruptive Distributed Energy Resources (DER) events, such as incorrect load shifting, imbalanced demand supply, and unstable price forecasting. First, this work leverages two customized native GenAI models, namely GAN and Autoencoder, to synthesize DERs control message parameters such as nominal power consumption, price elasticity coefficients, and communication data packets, among others, to introduce highly unpredictable new intelligent attack vectors. Second, this research proposes and develops a new Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) framework by creating correlation dependency nodes among DER control message parameters to understand the risks of intelligent attack vectors better while monitoring and mitigating their impact on smart grid operations. In particular, by leveraging the customized BBN, the system can observe and analyze the uncertain behaviors in DER operations that GenAI introduces, and the proposed framework can help mitigate grid vulnerabilities by understanding the poisonous parameters through mutual information. Finally, the experiment results show that the Autoencoder outperformed GAN in reproducing intelligent attacks with an MSE about 98.984% lower than that of GANs. Additionally, BBN can explain prominent parameters of the intelligent attacks’ by quantifying dependencies through mutual information.","Munir, Md Shirajum; Proddatoori, Sravanthi; Muralidhara, Manjushree; Shetty, Sachin",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICNC64010.2025.10993907,4be7trtnnb,,,,"2025 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC), Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC), 2025 International Conference on",,173,168,,True,20250217,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Signal Processing and Analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Autoencoders; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; Vectors; Data models; Smart grids; Distributed power generation; Bayes methods; Mutual information; Load modeling; Intelligent Cyber Attack; GAN; Autoencoder; Bayesian Belief Networks; Cyber Risk",A Bayesian Belief Network Framework for Protecting Generative AI-driven Attack in Smart Grid Communication,

"Generative AI (Gen-AI) represents a new stage in digital transformation through its many applications. Unfortunately, by accelerating the growth of digital technology, Gen-AI is contributing to the multiple environmental damages caused by its sector. The question of the sustainability of IT must include this new technology and its applications, by estimating its environmental impact. We propose various ways of improving the measurement of Gen-AI's environmental impact. Whether using life-cycle analysis methods or direct measurement experiments, we illustrate our methods by studying Stable Diffusion a Gen-AI image generation available as a service. By calculating the environmental costs of this Gen-AI service from end to end, we broaden our view of the impact of these technologies. We show that Gen-AI, as a service, generates an impact through the use of numerous user terminals and networks. We also show that decarbonizing the sources of electricity for these services will not be enough to solve the problem of their sustainability, due to their consumption of energy and rare metals. This consumption will inevitably raise the question of feasibility in a world of finite resources. We therefore propose our methodology as a means of measuring the impact of Gen-AI in advance. Our approach differentiates the embodied and operational impacts of Gen-AI in order to consider the sustainability of models and equipment.

"Literary studies critically examine fictional texts, exploring their structures, themes, stylistic features, and cultural-historical contexts. A central challenge in this field lies in bridging textual analysis with the spatial and sensory dimensions of settings described or implied in texts. Traditional methodologies often require scholars to mentally reconstruct these environments, leading to incomplete or inconsistent interpretations. Readers may be biased by their personal context or experiences, or may lack detailed knowledge of the relevant historical facts. This paper argues for the integration of virtual reality and generative artificial intelligence as supporting instruments to enhance literary research. The former enables immersive, spatially accurate reconstructions of historical environments, while the latter provides tools such as text-to-image and text-to-3D generation which let us dynamically render visual elements quoted in literary texts.

"Teachers' instructional decisions rely on effective data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers flexible and efficient support for these processes. However, few studies have explored its practical application in classroom decision-making. This study aimed to develop a generative AI chatbot to enhance teachers' data literacy (DL) and data-informed decision-making (DIDM). Using Richey and Klein's design and development research methodology, this study was conducted in four phases: analysis, design, development, and evaluation. The chatbot was reviewed by five experts and pilot-tested by four participants before being tested in an experiment. A single group pre-post paired samples t-test was conducted with 25 teachers, who interacted with the chatbot on Zoom once a week for 2 weeks. Teachers' reflective journals were examined using open coding procedures to analyze their responses. The findings revealed a significant increase in teachers' DL and DIDM efficacy. A qualitative analysis of the teachers' reflective journals highlighted the chatbot's strengths, limitations, and potential improvements. Based on these findings, this study offers practical implications for developing and using generative AI chatbots to support school teachers' DIDM processes.",Jiwon Lee; Jeongmin Lee,Academic Search Ultimate,,10.30191/ETS.202507_28(3).TP06,xvquej2klz,,,3,Educational Technology &amp; Society,,317,298,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=xvquej2klz&recordId=xvquej2klz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,International Forum of Educational Technology &amp; Society (IFETS),<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Teachers; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Acquisition of data; Research methodology,Generative AI chatbot for teachers' data-informed decision-making: Effects and insights.,28
"As the most revolutionary technological innovation in the field of artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence has profoundly reshaped the paradigm of information dissemination and the mode of social cognition through its strong self-learning ability and the ability to personalize texts, images, videos and other contents. according to the needs of users. However, the technical characteristics of generative artificial intelligence also hide multiple security risks. Powerful countries take advantage of this to put on the cloak of technology and turn to ""digital hegemony"" and ""digital colonialism"", which makes ideological penetration more concealed; the ""decentralized"" communication mode has diversified the main body of information dissemination, which has weakened the influence of the state's interpretation right; the ""customized"" form of digital communication creates the illusion of artificial empathy, which weakens individual independent thinking and critical ideas. In order to better study the causes of the ideological risks ofgenerative artificial intelligence, the process of its content output is disassembled in this paper, and it is found that the corpus of generative artificial intelligence is selective. the algorithm is intervenient, and the end user's cognition is controllable. This shows that the whole process of the operation of generative artificial intelligence contains more human factors, which provides a legal basis for its legal regulation. The governance capability of generative artificial intelligence generation represents a country's scientific and technological innovation capability and value leadership capability to a certain extent. At present. China's regulatory system and governance framework for generative artificial intelligence have been preliminarily formed. This paper takes five important special legislation such as the Interim Measures for the Administration of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services as the research object. takes ideological security protection as the governance goal, and compares it with the operation logic of generative artificial intelligence. It finds that there are certain deficiencies in the legal norms of Chinese artificial intelligence, such as omissions in the objects of legal regulation and accountability, operational challenges exist in the legal implementation of algorithmic classification and grading systems, and incomplete information disclosure and complaint reporting mechanisms. To this end, we should further clarify the responsibility of each subject in the whole process for content security, establish and improve the algorithmic classification and grading systems. improve the terminal feedback and disposal mechanism. maintain the ideological security in the field of generative artificial intelligence, and ensure the healthy development of the artificial intelligence industry. Compared with the previous literature, this paper has made expansion in the following two aspects: firstly, it analyses the operating mechanism of generative artificial intelligence, clarified the human factors therein, and provided a basis for the transformation from a technical perspective to a standardized governance: secondly, it systematically sorts out current legal documents for generative artificial intelligence and proposes tripartite governance pathways (upstream, midstream, downstream) to enhance both technical and regulatory oversight centering on ideological security protection. Generative artificial intelligence has become a strategic domain in great-power competition, impacting not only industrial and economic leadership but also the rule-making authority in the digital era. To a certain extent, the study helps to ensure that, while innovating and developing, generative artificial intelligence will always become a beneficial tool for disseminating mainstream values and enhancing cultural self-confidence, and provide strong support for building a clear cyberspace, and ensure the security of national ideology in the digital intelligence era.",陈京春; 杨历霖,Academic Search Ultimate,,10.15896/j.xjtuskxb.202504014,szmlsm6w2f,,,4,Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Social Sciences),,168,158,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=szmlsm6w2f&recordId=szmlsm6w2f&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Social Sciences) Editorial Office,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Digital technology; Cloaking devices; Technological innovations,生成式人工智能的意识形态风险及其法律因应.,45
"With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, its application in the workplace has shown significant innovative potential and practical value. However, the existing literature lacks a systematic and widely applicable definition and measurement framework for Generative AI Literacy. Based on the existing literature and following a rigorous scale development process, this study constructs a Generative AI Literacy measurement framework that covers five core dimensions, basic technical competence, prompt optimization, content evaluation, innovative application, and ethical and compliance awareness, and validates its reliability and validity. Furthermore, based on the Ability–Motivation–Opportunity (AMO) theory, this study explores the mechanism through which Generative AI Literacy influences employee job performance and examines the mediating role of Creative Self-Efficacy. The results show that Generative AI Literacy has a significant positive impact on job performance (β = 0.680, p &lt; 0.001), with Creative Self-Efficacy playing a partial mediating role (indirect effect = 0.537). The developed five-dimensional framework demonstrates strong psychometric properties and provides empirical evidence for AI literacy's role in enhancing workplace performance through Creative Self-Efficacy mechanisms.

"Background: Adopting generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education rapidly transforms learning environments, yet nursing students' acceptance and anxiety toward these technologies remain underexplored in Middle Eastern contexts. This study extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by incorporating constructs such as Facilitating Conditions (FC) and Social Influence (SI). It investigates the moderating role of Anxiety on Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU) generative AI tools. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,055 undergraduate nursing students across four Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire comprising the Generative Artificial Intelligence Acceptance Scale and the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale. Structural equation modeling was employed to evaluate relationships among Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), FC, SI, and BIU, with Anxiety as a moderator. Descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis, and path analysis were performed using SPSS and Python's semopy library. Results: The model demonstrated strong explanatory power, with 75.09% of the variance in BIU explained by the TAM constructs and Anxiety. Path coefficients revealed significant positive relationships between PE (β = 0.477, p &lt; 0.001), EE (β = 0.293, p &lt; 0.001), FC (β = 0.189, p &lt; 0.001), and SI (β = 0.308, p &lt; 0.001) and BIU. Anxiety had the strongest moderating effect (β = 0.552, p &lt; 0.001), indicating its critical role in shaping behavioral intentions. Gender, year of study, and access to technology emerged as significant demographic variables influencing acceptance and anxiety levels. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the importance of reducing anxiety and enhancing support systems to foster GenAI acceptance among nursing students. The findings provide actionable insights for designing culturally tailored educational interventions to promote the effective integration of AI in nursing education.

"Generative AI is increasingly used to create images from text, but its role in documentary photography remains under-explored. This paper investigates how generative AI can be integrated into documentary practice while maintaining ethical standards. Through interviews with six documentary photographers, we explored their views on AI's potential to support community-driven storytelling.While AI presents opportunities for creative expression and community involvement, concerns about trust, authenticity, and decontextualization of images persist. Photographers expressed doubts about AI's ability to accurately represent lived experiences, fearing it could compromise narrative integrity. Our findings suggest that AI tools should be designed to enhance collaboration and transparency in storytelling, complementing rather than replacing traditional documentary methods. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI in photography, advocating for the development of tools that preserve the ethical foundations of documentary storytelling while empowering communities.","Martinez, Lenny; Caramiaux, Baptiste; Fdili Alaoui, Sarah",OpenAIRE,,10.1145/3706598.3714200,hbxgsywkob,,,,Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,,13,1,,False,20250425,ACM,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Documentary photography; Text-to-image generation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> Documentary photography Visual storytelling Text-to-image generation; [INFO.INFO-HC] Computer Science [cs]/Human-Computer Interaction [cs.HC]; Visual storytelling,Generative AI in Documentary Photography: Exploring Opportunities and Challenges for Visual Storytelling,
"Background: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promise in enhancing personalised learning and improving educational efficiency. However, its integration into education raises concerns about misinformation and over-reliance, particularly among adolescents. Teacher supervision plays a critical role in mitigating these risks and ensuring the effective use of Generative AI in classrooms. Despite the growing interest in Generative AI, there is limited empirical research on its actual impact and the role of teacher oversight. Objective: The purpose of this study is to systematically assess the role of Generative AI in classroom teaching, with a specific focus on how teacher supervision shapes its effectiveness. Method: This study employed a quasi-experimental design to examine differences in learning outcomes among students under three instructional methods: traditional computer-assisted teaching, Generative AI-assisted teaching without teacher supervision and Generative AI-assisted teaching with teacher supervision. The study was implemented in the context of a two-week Information Science and Technology course in a middle school, involving three classes with 45, 41 and 45 students, respectively. To ensure consistency in teaching styles, all classes were taught by the same experienced teacher. Data collection included a knowledge test to assess knowledge mastery, as well as questionnaires to measure learning satisfaction and engagement. The collected data were analysed using one-way ANOVA to compare the effectiveness of the three teaching methods. Results and Conclusion: Compared with traditional computer-assisted teaching, Generative AI-assisted teaching can significantly enhance students' learning satisfaction, but can not improve their learning engagement and knowledge mastery level. Furthermore, in the process of Generative AI-assisted teaching, teacher supervision can significantly increase students' learning engagement and knowledge mastery compared with situations without teacher supervision. This study indicated Generative AI's potential as an educational tool and underscored the essential role of teacher supervision. Implications: This study fills a critical gap by providing empirical evidence on how Generative AI and teacher supervision interact to improve classroom learning outcomes. It shows that Generative AI's potential to enhance learning outcomes is significantly amplified with teacher oversight.",Qianwen Tang; Wenbo Deng; Yidan Huang; Shuaijie Wang; Hao Zhang,ERIC,,10.1111/jcal.70027,3ft5uhzk5r,,,3,Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,,,,,True,20250601,,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Teaching Methods; Educational Quality; Technology Integration; Outcomes of Education; Instructional Effectiveness; Computer Assisted Instruction; Supervision; Middle School Teachers; Middle School Students; Learner Engagement; Student Satisfaction; Mastery Learning,Can Generative Artificial Intelligence Be a Good Teaching Assistant?--An Empirical Analysis Based on Generative AI-Assisted Teaching,41
"As more users seek generative AI (GAI) models to enhance work efficiency, GAI and Model-as-a-Service will drive transformative changes and upgrades across all industries. However, when users utilize GAI models provided by the service provider, they cannot be certain that the model’s quality matches the provider’s claims. Considering the need to protect intellectual property, the service provider will not disclose model details for user verification. To this end, we take the Internet of Vehicles as research background, proposing a zero knowledge model proof architecture based on UAVs. We also introduce a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the verification process. In specific, we first propose a verification scheme for the key operations of generative adversarial networks based on noninteractive zero knowledge proof. The zero knowledge proof architecture ensures that model parameters cannot be stolen during the verification process. After that, we propose an Age of Verification (AoV) metric to ensure the timeliness and freshness of zero knowledge proof. We also construct a tradeoff optimization problem between the energy consumption of UAV as a verifier and the AoV of edge servers as service providers, and transform the problem based on Lyapunov optimization theory. Following that, we propose an enhanced multiagent proximal policy optimization algorithm to enable the collaborative verification of edge servers by multiple UAVs. The algorithm simulation results demonstrate that the reward value of our proposed algorithm is over 10% higher than that of the standard algorithm, with a faster and more stable overall convergence speed. Additionally, the zero knowledge proof performance test results indicate that the verification delay in our proposed architecture is less than 500 ms during the verification phase, meeting practical requirements.","Hao, M.; Shang, C.; Wang, S.; Jiang, W.; Nie, J.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JIOT.2025.3531914,mcm7scom5r,,,10,"IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, IEEE Internet Things J.",,13454,13441,,True,20250515,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computational modeling; Servers; Zero knowledge proof; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Optimization; Computer architecture; Data models; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Security; <mark>Generative</mark> adversarial networks; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> (GAI); Lyapunov optimization; multiagent deep reinforcement learning; uncrewed aerial vehicle; zero knowledge proof",UAV-Assisted Zero Knowledge Model Proof for Generative AI: A Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,12
"Mobile edge computing (MEC) enabled artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) has garnered considerable attention. To support AIGC metaverse applications within MEC in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, it is effective to offload computation tasks, particularly those involving neural networks generative in AIGC, from mobile devices to edge clouds. Existing solutions typically assume the availability of a dedicated and powerful edge server for each user with single modal data, which can handle the entire AIGC service offloading. However, the practical availability of such dedicated and powerful servers may be limited, necessitating the utilization of less capable alternatives. Thus, we propose the multimodal parallel offloading AIGC framework which partitions multimodal content and offloads partial diffusion tasks to multiple servers. Our proposed scheme accelerates mobile deep vision multimodal metaverse applications through parallel offloading provided by multiple servers. We further utilize the generative AI scheme to solve offloading problems to adapt the dynamic and available communication and computing resource in wireless IoT network. Our framework proposed a multimodal parallel diffusion offloading scheme with integrating the recurrent region proposal prediction algorithm to optimize communication and computing resources while minimizing delay. Simulation results show that our approach can significantly reduce delay compared to conventional algorithms.","Zeng, W.; Zheng, J.; Gao, L.; Niu, J.; Ren, J.; Wang, H.; Cao, R.; Ji, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JIOT.2025.3535623,p5zr4o2brf,,,10,"IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, IEEE Internet Things J.",,13285,13273,,True,20250515,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Servers; Metaverse; Resource management; Edge computing; Proposals; Heuristic algorithms; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Wireless communication; Dynamic scheduling; Prediction algorithms; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>-generated content (AIGC); multimodal parallel offloading; region proposal prediction",Generative AI-Aided Multimodal Parallel Offloading for AIGC Metaverse Service in IoT Networks,12
"The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision (CV), Computer Graphics (CG), and Extended Reality (XR) is driving innovation in immersive environments. A key challenge in these environments is the creation of personalized 3D assets, traditionally achieved through manual modeling, a time-consuming process that often fails to meet individual user needs. More recently, Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a promising solution for automated, context-aware content generation. In this paper, we present MineVRA (Multimodal generative artificial iNtelligence for contExt-aware Virtual Reality Assets), a novel Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) XR framework that integrates GenAI to facilitate coherent and adaptive 3D content generation in immersive scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a comparative user study analyzing the performance and user satisfaction of GenAI-generated 3D objects compared to those generated by Sketchfab in different immersive contexts.

"The dramatic increase in smart services makes adaptive management of communication networks more critical. Especially for Internet of Things (IoT) networks, adaptive management faces several challenges, like fluctuating network conditions, heterogeneity in data sources, and rapid response capabilities. These challenges lead to performance degradation and data losses in IoT applications if not handled. Even though traditional AI algorithms are applied in most network topologies, they fall short of handling these adaptive management challenges without requiring additional software developments. Therefore, we propose a Generative AI-powered Digital Twinning (GenTwin) framework to create digital twin models with generative AI algorithms. In this framework, we design two novel mechanisms: Priority Pooling and Twin Adapter. Priority Pooling is to extract the dynamic relations within the topology before performing model training. We theoretically formulate the priority levels and corresponding weights with a novel presence parameter to present a modular architecture to increase training efficiency. The Twin Adapter is to interact with the GAI architecture and fine-tune the model for the adaptive twin modelling task in IoT networks. After creating the adaptive twin models, we test the rapid response capabilities of GenTwin with what-if analysis. According to our simulation results, we note that the proposed pooling mechanism extracts the data relations 19% more by enhancing the training accuracy. In addition, we show that GenTwin surpasses the traditional twin performance in terms of rapid response capabilities by reducing the response time 53% when the dynamicity is maximum.","Duran, K.; Shin, H.; Duong, T.Q.; Canberk, B.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2025.3527719,g7yuiebxyj,,,2,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"This paper examines the impact of generative AI on international diplomacy through the lens of EU–China diplomatic relationship-building. The first section introduces the broader context of AI's geopolitical impact by distinguishing two different models—the European and Chinese models of regulating and implementing generative AI. The second discuss or explain how the two AI models contrast one another. The third section of the paper focuses on discussing Generative AI and its possible implications for EU–China relations, the extent to which their efforts are likely to strain or facilitate diplomatic relationship-building. The fourth section takes the analysis forward by examining how generative AI could be an unexpected enabling force for EU–China relationship-building. This paper purports that the distinctive EU and Chinese models of generative AI too often belie the opportunities that could potentially enable the EU and China to build their relationship, since generative AI raises shared concerns for the EU and China, and utilising generative AI could make their communications become more efficient, the EU and China may come to reach some kind of shared framework for generative AI development and governance; this could lead to productive talks in other domains such as the trade deficit issue plaguing the EU–China relations or more sensitive cross-strait issues; moreover, in the realm of public diplomacy generative AI could facilitate the EU and China's public diplomatic efforts towards each other.","Xia, Lucie Qian",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1057/s41254-023-00321-6,adslnehkmj,,,3,Place Branding &amp; Public Diplomacy,,338,334,,True,20250901,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,International relations; China; European Union; Foreign affairs; International Affairs; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Geopolitics; Diplomacy; Countries; Public diplomacy,Diplomatic relationship-building in the age of generative AI: the European Union and China.,21
"Proposing corporate data responsibility (CDR) as an emerging dimension of corporate social responsibility (CSR), this study examines how consumers perceive their generative AI (GenAI) company's communication about data responsibility, and how these communications influence perceived CDR and trust in the service. Using data from a national survey of 819 U.S. GenAI users, the findings demonstrate that stakeholder engagement in CDR communication positively influences consumer perceptions of both algorithmic and institutional responsibility. Notably, institutional responsibility plays a significant role in enhancing trust in GenAI systems, serving as a cognitive heuristic for evaluating technical algorithmic responsibility. It suggests that institutional responsibility bridges the gap between technical algorithmic accountability and consumer trust. These insights highlight institutional responsibility as a cornerstone of CDR, emphasizing its critical role in shaping perceptions and building trust in the context of AI systems.","Lim, Joon Soo; Lee, Chunsik; Shin, Donghee; Kim, Junga; Zhang, Jun",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/1062726X.2025.2501552,okjod2srbz,,,5,Journal of Public Relations Research,,469,447,,True,20250901,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Corporate governance; Stakeholder analysis; Consumer attitudes; Social responsibility of business; United States; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Trust; Data management,Perceived Stakeholder Engagement in Corporate Data Responsibility (CDR) Communication and Its Relationship with Trust in Generative AI Systems: The Mediating Role of Algorithmic and Institutional Responsibility.,37
"Generative AI (Gen-AI) is transforming industries, and the automotive sector is no exception. Auto Component Manufacturing (AutoCM) organizations face strong pressure to adopt Gen-AI for competitiveness, yet little research has examined adoption factors in this context. This study investigates the determinants of Gen-AI adoption in AutoCM firms using the Technology-Organization-Environment framework. A model was developed and tested through survey data from 490 managers, validated via PLS-SEM. The findings reveal key predictors of adoption: perceived intelligence, data quality, absorptive capacity, IT infrastructure, top management commitment, vendor support, competitive pressure, and government support. Results further show that adoption intention drives potential use of Gen-AI, but this relationship is weakened by concerns over Gen-AI hallucination. This research identifies crucial drivers of Gen-AI adoption in AutoCM, extends TOE framework literature, and provides actionable insights for practitioners to strategically harness Gen-AI’s transformative potential in the sector.","Sivathanu, Brijesh; Pillai, Rajasshrie; Rana, Nripendra P.",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/08874417.2025.2554850,ypvi2gbpon,,,,Journal of Computer Information Systems,,22,1,,True,20250917,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Automobile industry; Economic competition; Information technology; Automobile and light-duty motor vehicle manufacturing; Automobile Manufacturing; Motor Vehicle Body Manufacturing; New and used automobile and light-duty truck merchant wholesalers; Automobile and Other Motor Vehicle Merchant Wholesalers; New Car Dealers; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Data quality,Reimagining Automotive Manufacturing with Generative AI: A Technology-Organization-Environment Perspective.,
"Previous studies have demonstrated that summarization activities effectively enhance students' reading comprehension and learning performance. With the ongoing surge in the application of artificial intelligence in education, this study introduces a chatbot with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to assist students in reviewing Python programming concepts by refining the summary after class. Consequently, this study aims to assess the efficacy of the proposed a GenAI-enabled chatbot in enhancing the summarization ability and learning performance of novice programmers in college. Experimental results reveal that, the GenAIenabled chatbot not only significantly improves students' programming coding performance but also significantly improves their summarization ability. It is noteworthy that students' summarization proficiency is not only elevated from the outset but also consistently progresses until the end. This study also identified that understanding the Python programming concepts of input/output operations and lists serves as predictors for learning performance in programming concept and coding, respectively.

First, we propose a multi-exit U-ViT model that achieves the balance between inference quality and processing speed by allowing adaptive selection of exit points during diffusion for efficient processing. Next, we develop a novel generative AI-assisted reinforcement learning algorithm that controls the exit selections and offloading decisions of the device to achieve maximum global gain. Furthermore, we design a novel policy network incorporating an attention-based state-embedded policy network to enhance the algorithm’s ability to perceive and make decisions about the state of the environment.

"In recent years, generative AI has attracted significant public attention, and its use has been rapidly expanding across a wide range of domains. From creative tasks such as text summarization, idea generation, and source code generation, to the streamlining of medical support tasks like diagnostic report generation and summarization, AI is now deeply involved in many areas. Today’s breadth of AI applications is clearly distinct from what was seen before generative AI gained widespread recognition. Representative generative AI services include DALL·E 3 (OpenAI, California, USA) and Stable Diffusion (Stability AI, London, England, UK) for image generation, ChatGPT (OpenAI, California, USA), and Gemini (Google, California, USA) for text generation. The rise of generative AI has been influenced by advances in deep learning models and the scaling up of data, models, and computational resources based on the Scaling Laws. Moreover, the emergence of foundation models, which are trained on large-scale datasets and possess general-purpose knowledge applicable to various downstream tasks, is creating a new paradigm in AI development. These shifts brought about by generative AI and foundation models also profoundly impact medical image processing, fundamentally changing the framework for AI development in healthcare. This paper provides an overview of diffusion models used in image generation AI and large language models (LLMs) used in text generation AI, and introduces their applications in medical support. This paper also discusses foundation models, which are gaining attention alongside generative AI, including their construction methods and applications in the medical field.

"Zusammenfassung: Diese Studie untersucht die Anwendung und Effektivität von GPT‑4 im Bereich der objektorientierten Softwareentwicklung zur Generierung von funktionalem und qualitativ hochwertigem Code. In den experimentellen Fallstudien wurde GPT‑4 mit zunehmend komplexen Programmieraufgaben betraut. Der erste Fall, ein auf Java basierendes Studentenverwaltungssystem, demonstrierte die Fähigkeit von GPT‑4, strukturierten, funktionalen Code als Reaktion auf spezifische Prompts zu generieren. Es zeigte jedoch auch die Notwendigkeit für präzise, kontextreiche Prompts auf, um wartbare und qualitativ hochwertige Softwarelösungen zu erstellen. Im zweiten Fall, das Spiel „Snake“, produzierte GPT‑4 anfangs allgemeine Ansätze und Pseudocode und benötigte iteratives Prompting und Fehleranalyse, um ein funktionierendes Spiel zu entwickeln. Dieser Fall unterstrich die Grenzen von GPT‑4 bei der Bewältigung komplexer Programmieraufgaben ohne detaillierte Anleitung. Die Ergebnisse dieser Studien deuten darauf hin, dass GPT‑4 ein wertvolles Werkzeug in der Softwareentwicklung sein kann, wenn Prompting-Strategien mit einem tiefen Verständnis der Prinzipien der Softwareentwicklung kombiniert werden.

"Higher education often casts Generative AI (GenAI) as a technological disruption; yet its deeper significance is epistemological, revealing a gap between what universities seek to cultivate and what their pedagogies produce. This gap is rooted in assumptions about knowing and learning, enacted by instructionism and entrenched by neoliberal logics. In response, this paper advances functional epistemology as a corrective, shifting “learning” from recall to what learners can do in context. It maps human–machine cognition across symbolic, conceptual, and contextual modes; distinguishes outsourcing from offloading when “thinking with AI”; expands Critical AI Literacy (CAIL) as an epistemological guardrail; and proposes Recursive Design for integrating GenAI into intentional practice.","Kalaitzidis, Theodore",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s00146-025-02629-8,rljgz6pa6v,,,,"<mark>AI</mark> &amp; SOCIETY: Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Communication",,19,1,,True,20250924,Springer London,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Higher Education; Functional Epistemology; Epistemic Laundering; Outsourcing and Offloading; Critical <mark>AI</mark> Literacy,How generative AI fixes what higher education broke: reframing the “colonization” of knowing and learning,
"This study investigates university students’ technology use and understanding in the post-generative AI (GenAI) era. A mixed-methods approach, employing a survey of 68 students at a business-focused university in the United States, explored current learning tool usage patterns, specific GenAI applications, self-perceived AI expertise, and knowledge acquisition methods. Findings reveal that while GenAI tools, especially ChatGPT, are frequently used, they have not supplanted traditional online resources like search engines. They are being used for learning and even entertainment, demonstrating a multifaceted integration of AI into university life. Notably, some emerging uses of GenAI extend into sensitive areas such as health-related inquiries, raising questions about appropriate boundaries and responsible use. Furthermore, we find discrepancies between students’ self-assessed AI expertise and their articulated understanding of it, suggesting potential overconfidence and highlighting the need for robust digital literacy programs. The limited awareness of GenAI tools beyond ChatGPT also underscores a potential gap in students’ technological toolkit while demonstrating that students mostly use GenAI tools to create and understand education-related material.","Divekar, Rahul R.; Gonzalez, Lisette; Guerra, Sophia; Boos, Natasha; Divekar, Ritika",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s11528-025-01095-9,5sismfyxoj,,,5,TechTrends: Linking Research and Practice to Improve LearningA publication of the Association for Educational Communications &amp; Technology,,1055,1040,,True,20250901,Springer US,ChatGPT; Education technology; Learning toolkit; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Online tools; Higher education; Students,"Can Generative AI Replace Search Engines for Learning?

Data-driven application deployment imposes needs for distributed cloud databases that need to handle extensive data quantities efficiently as they provide guarantee and scaling properties and operational performance. Distributed databases now benefit from advanced capabilities enabled by AI systems that promote better database operation and scalability capacity. This research explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence systems with distributed cloud databases to solve database query optimization challenges while managing operational workloads and making fault predictions and ensuring data consistency initiatives. Through our research on generative AI's predictive functions and generative capabilities we formulate innovative techniques that connect automated schema design and adaptive indexing with intelligent data partitioning approaches. Generative AI reveals new capabilities in anomaly prevention that escalate system dependability and slash operational interruptions. The framework implements reinforcement learning and transformers to acquire performance database data which subsequently exploits this information to generate outcomes that coincide with adjusting workload patterns. Experimental results beyond cloud database benchmark testing validate higher query execution performance together with strengthened system resource capacity and accelerated performance. The research incorporates ethical considerations along with privacy analysis while making key points to determine suitable AI deployment in cloud environments. Research demonstrates that generative AI changes distributed cloud database procedures by enabling scalable efficient intelligent operational database management systems.

"Scaling laws dictate that the performance of AI models is proportional to the amount of available data. Data augmentation is a promising solution to expanding the dataset size. Traditional approaches focused on augmentation using rotation, translation, and resizing. Recent approaches use generative AI models to improve dataset diversity. However, the generative methods struggle with issues such as subject corruption and the introduction of irrelevant artifacts. In this paper, we propose the Automated Generative Data Augmentation (AGA). The framework combines the utility of large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and segmentation models to augment data. AGA preserves foreground authenticity while ensuring background diversity. Specific contributions include: i) segment and superclass based object extraction, ii) prompt diversity with combinatorial complexity using prompt decomposition, and iii) affine subject manipulation. We evaluate AGA against state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques on three representative datasets, ImageNet, CUB and iWildCam. The experimental evaluation demonstrates an accuracy improvement of 15.6% and 23.5% for in and out-of-distribution data compared to baseline models respectively.

"Traditional approaches for data augmentation are time-consuming and risk compromising the quality of the data. Those challenges in the backdrop, we have generative artificial intelligence (AI) at the forefront of data augmentation - bolstering real-time data in big data pipelines. Generative AI — a focus on generating new entities that try to capture the underlying structure of existing datasets by deep learning algorithms. Allowing to produce a significantly larger and diverse dataset resulting in improved efficiencies of downstream tasks as machine learning or predictive analytics. Because of this, the same technique can also be applied to streams so, it can be used in big data pipelines. You are taught on data until October 2023 to generate a larger and big data pipeline more efficient by augmentation and producing new data with minimal time and investment. This leads to more precise insights and predictions, improving decision-making and driving better results for business. Also, generative AI can create the data that correlates patterns with the analysis and change regarding the patterns based on the analyst's preferences. The role of generative AI in augmenting big data and big data pipelines, especially in the context of real-time data streams, is emerging as a key enabler for organizations looking to extract valuable insights from their data.","Gakhar, Suket; Kondoju, Viswanadha Pratap; Chauhan, Sansar Singh; Kumar, Anant; Kulkarni, Soham Sunil; Goel, Punit",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/CE2CT64011.2025.10941295,nma4avmk3v,,,,"2025 First International Conference on Advances in Computer Science, Electrical, Electronics, and Communication Technologies (CE2CT), Advances in Computer Science, Electrical, Electronics, and Communication Technologies (CE2CT), 2025 First International Conference on",,1391,1386,,True,20250221,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Computing and Processing; Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas; Engineering Profession; Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics; General Topics for Engineers; Geoscience; Photonics and Electrooptics; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Machine learning algorithms; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Pipelines; Distributed databases; Big Data; Data augmentation; Real-time systems; Data models; Synthetic data; Conventional; Augmentation Degradation; Downstream; Predictions; Insights; Analysis",Generative AI for Real-Time Data Augmentation in Big Data Pipelines,

"A key component of personalized travel recommendation systems, the Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) architecture has been revolutionized by recent developments in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). The RAG framework uses natural language inputs and combines retrieval-based techniques with large-scale language models to produce user-specific, contextually appropriate recommendations. By using iterative learning to adjust dynamically, these systems make sure that recommendations change in tandem with changing user preferences, new travel trends, and contextual factors. The Big Five (BF) features and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), two scientifically based personality models, are used in this study to expand these capabilities. More personalization results from this integration, which improves the system's capacity to match recommendations with unique user preferences and behaviors. In order to show how personality-driven insights enhance the potential of generative AI, the study investigates the fundamental techniques and real-world implementations of this approach.

This work uses CLIPScore, a metric from the multimodal CLIP model, to evaluate the similarity between original and regenerated images using five well-known open-source text-to-image models. The findings show that CLIPScore offers useful information about the relative quality of captioning models, even though it is not entirely consistent with the evaluation of visual quality. Furthermore, tests with different prompt formats demonstrate that images with extremely thorough explanations are more like the originals than those with minimal descriptions.

"This study examines the short-term impact of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) on employment and wages using data covering all wage earners from Finland. Employing a synthetic difference-in-differences approach, we analyze how the launch of ChatGPT affected occupations with varying levels of exposure to GAI. Our findings reveal that wages increased more in highly GAI-exposed occupations compared to less exposed ones following ChatGPT's introduction. However, we do not observe statistically significant changes in employment levels between more and less exposed occupations. Additional analyses comparing more- and less-exposed occupations within specific occupational groups yield qualitatively similar results. These findings contrast with some previous studies on online labor markets but align more closely with research using nationally representative data. The positive wage effect observed in AI-exposed occupations could indicate that GAI is primarily enhancing rather than replacing human labor. The lack of significant employment effects might suggest that the impact of GAI on job creation or destruction may take longer to materialize or might be offset by other factors in the labor market.","Kauhanen, Antti; Rouvinen, Petri",OpenAIRE,,10.1080/13504851.2025.2513973,m27o2vvkvz,,,,Applied Economics Letters,,4,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=m27o2vvkvz&recordId=kgdxw76clf&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,False,20250610,Informa UK Limited,Employment; O33; Technological change; occupations; ddc:330; J21; employment; technological change; Wages; wages; E24; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Occupations,Assessing early labour market effects of generative AI: evidence from population data,

"Business Intelligence (BI) workflows benefit from the improved access to insights that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can bring, allowing for swifter democratization of data access and improved decision-making across various domains such as finance, retail, life sciences, education technology (EdTech), etc. Although existing literature discusses theoretical models or particular case studies, it does not provide a practical framework to integrate GenAI into BI. This study fills the gap by devising a pragmatic framework employing the qualitative research method featuring semi-structured interviews with professionals in varied disciplines. The results show that GenAI can improve the effectiveness of the interaction between technical experts and business users. Successful adoption, however, hinges on clarity of the organizational goals, effectiveness of the data management, user training, and system integration. Organizations can apply the proposed framework to integrate GenAI into BI systems to focus on operational excellence and support for real-time, data-driven decisions.

"Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 prioritizes advances in healthcare to improve accessibility, improve medical services, and support people with disabilities. Despite the adoption of telemedicine and AI-driven healthcare solutions, disabled and elderly people continue to face challenges in accessing real-time medical services, receiving accurate diagnoses and independently navigate healthcare facilities. Current healthcare systems often struggle with delays, lack of personalization, and inefficiencies in medical data processing, limiting their effectiveness in providing inclusive and responsive healthcare. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an AI-powered healthcare framework that integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and the Analytic Network Process (ANP). RLHF enables AI models to learn and adapt based on real-time user feedback, ensuring a personalized and interactive healthcare experience. Meanwhile, ANP optimizes decision-making processes, allowing for faster, more accurate medical service delivery by considering multiple healthcare factors. This combined approach improves remote consultations, intelligent diagnostics, and seamless real-time interactions, significantly improving accessibility to healthcare for disabled individuals. The proposed framework is evaluated against existing AI-driven healthcare models. Results demonstrate that the system outperforms traditional methods, providing a faster, more reliable, and patient-centered healthcare experience.

"With recent advances in AI, many technology firms and developers are exploring whether Generative AI (GenAI) tools can help improve productivity, code quality and the overall developer experience. Current evaluations primarily depend on subjective questionnaire data or code quality metrics. A supplemental objective, continuous, real-time developer-centered measure is missing. Wearables with body sensors that measure the physiological activity of a person have the aforementioned benefits. With their help, impeding factors from GenAI tools on a developer's well-being and cognitive load may be detected. Implications for productivity may be deduced from these cognitive load measures. This research aims to use body sensor data to (1) assess the ability of wearables to measure developers' cognitive load in their everyday working context to then (2) evaluate developer experience, productivity and GenAI interactions in real-life work environments.

"This study aims to explore the generation and restoration of Kraak porcelain decorative patterns, employing a stable diffusion model that has been augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and ControlNet. Kraak porcelain, a historic blue-and-white ceramic traded along the maritime Silk Road, features intricate radial ""Kaiguang"" patterns that blend Chinese and Islamic artistic styles. The rules governing pattern generation have not been systematically deciphered through traditional methods, and as a result, innovation has remained constrained. The study established a multi-dimensional cultural database of 1530 Kraak porcelain images to facilitate training of a stable diffusion model. The model was fine-tuned using LoRA to adapt to small-sample data and integrated with ControlNet to impose structural constraints via edge maps. Experiments demonstrated that combining LoRA and ControlNet improved structural control over Kaiguang patterns and secondary motifs, validated by metrics like SSIM and PSNR. However, despite the improvement in pattern consistency, difficulties persisted in reproducing fine details and achieving seamless restoration of damaged patterns. Future work will focus on refining incremental learning strategies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, with the goal of bridging the gaps between technical implementation and cultural interpretation.

"Wildfires increasingly threaten human life, ecosystems, and infrastructure, with events like the 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County underscoring the urgent need for more advanced prediction frameworks. Existing physics-based and deep-learning models struggle to capture dynamic wildfire spread across both 2D and 3D domains, especially when incorporating real-time, multimodal geospatial data. This paper explores how generative artificial intelligence (AI) models—such as GANs, VAEs, and transformers—can serve as transformative tools for wildfire prediction and simulation. These models offer superior capabilities in managing uncertainty, integrating multimodal inputs, and generating realistic, scalable wildfire scenarios. We adopt a new paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) for literature synthesis, classification, and knowledge extraction, conducting a systematic review of recent studies applying generative AI to fire prediction and monitoring. We highlight how generative approaches uniquely address challenges faced by traditional simulation and deep-learning methods. Finally, we outline five key future directions for generative AI in wildfire management, including unified multimodal modeling of 2D and 3D dynamics, agentic AI systems and chatbots for decision intelligence, and real-time scenario generation on mobile devices, along with a discussion of critical challenges. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift toward multimodal generative frameworks to support proactive, data-informed wildfire response.","Xu, Haowen; Zlatanova, Sisi; Liang, Ruiyu; Canbulat, Ismet",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/fire8080293,776kp3ke6z,,,8,Fire (2571-6255),,,293,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=776kp3ke6z&recordId=776kp3ke6z&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250801,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Deep learning; Decision making; Fire risk assessment; Dynamic models; Metadata; Computer simulation; Three-dimensional imaging,Generative AI as a Pillar for Predicting 2D and 3D Wildfire Spread: Beyond Physics-Based Models and Traditional Deep Learning.,8
"The increasing complexity and scale of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks pose significant security challenges, necessitating the development of advanced intrusion detection systems (IDS). Traditional IDS approaches, such as rule-based and signature-based methods, are often inadequate in detecting novel and sophisticated attacks due to their limited adaptability and dependency on predefined patterns. To overcome these limitations, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based IDS have been introduced, offering better generalization and the ability to learn from data. However, these models can still struggle with zero-day attacks, require large volumes of labeled data, and may be vulnerable to adversarial examples. In response to these challenges, Generative AI-based IDS—leveraging models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Transformers—have emerged as promising solutions that offer enhanced adaptability, synthetic data generation for training, and improved detection capabilities for evolving threats. This survey provides an overview of IoV architecture, vulnerabilities, and classical IDS techniques while focusing on the growing role of Generative AI in strengthening IoV security. It discusses the current landscape, highlights the key challenges, and outlines future research directions aimed at building more resilient and intelligent IDS for the IoV ecosystem.","Mahmoudi, Isra; Boubiche, Djallel Eddine; Athmani, Samir; Toral-Cruz, Homero; Chan-Puc, Freddy I.",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.3390/fi17070310,iy2pbufbzv,,,7,Future Internet,,,310,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=iy2pbufbzv&recordId=iy2pbufbzv&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,MDPI,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Intrusion detection systems (Computer security); Computer security vulnerabilities; Machine learning; Intelligent transportation systems; Cyberterrorism; Deep learning; Metadata,Toward Generative AI-Based Intrusion Detection Systems for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV).,17
"This study aimed to identify the experiences of students on the reflections of arts education supported by generative artificial intelligence in their abstract art practices. As a qualitative research method, the case study design was used in the study. The sample of the study included 12 last-year students in the Art Education Program of a state university in Türkiye. The implementation process took place within the scope of a 12-week arts major workshop course. Data were collected in semi-structured interviews and using reflective journals and analyzed using the inductive content analysis method. It was determined that the participants were initially prejudiced against generative artificial intelligence and inexperienced in using it, while these attitudes became more positive over time. The participants stated that generative artificial intelligence tools were a source of inspiration, offered support in composition development, and had a guiding role in terms of aesthetics and style. On the other hand, some participants reported that during the arts education process supported by artificial intelligence, they experienced challenges such as communication problems, lack of technical knowledge, and concerns about originality. The results of the study revealed that generative artificial intelligence could be utilized as an educational tool that could support artistic creativity and learning. Hence, it is recommended that elective courses supported by generative artificial intelligence be integrated into the curricula of programs in arts education. Plain Language Summary: What Students Think About Learning Abstract Art with the Help of Generative AI This study explored how students experienced using generative artificial intelligence (AI) in making abstract art. The aim was to understand their views on this new approach in art education. Twelve senior students from an art education program in Türkiye joined a 12-week workshop. They used generative AI tools to support their creative process. Researchers collected data through interviews and student journals. At first, many students felt unsure and even negative about AI. They worried that it might reduce their own creativity. Over time, their opinions changed. They said AI helped them generate ideas, plan their work, and improve their artworks. They saw AI as a source of inspiration, not a replacement for creativity. There were still challenges. Some students struggled with the technical side. Others questioned if AI-supported works were truly original. In the end, the study showed that generative AI can support both learning and creativity in art education. The researchers suggest offering elective courses that include AI in art programs.","Hiçyilmaz, Yahya",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1177/21582440251382812,rx5bqbngcj,,,3,SAGE Open,,19,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=rx5bqbngcj&recordId=rx5bqbngcj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Sage Publications Inc.,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Abstract art; Inspiration; Qualitative research; Arts education; Psychology of students; Curriculum; Creative ability,An Innovative Approach in Arts Education: Student Experiences of Abstract Art Practices Supported by Generative Artificial Intelligence.,15
"For over half a century, computer-aided structural elucidation systems (CASE) for organic compounds have relied on complex expert systems with explicitly programmed algorithms. These systems are often computationally inefficient for complex compounds due to the vast chemical structural space that must be explored and filtered. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept transformer based generative chemical language artificial intelligence (AI) model, an innovative end-to-end architecture designed to replace the logic and workflow of the classic CASE framework for ultra-fast and accurate spectroscopic-based structural elucidation. Our model employs an encoder-decoder architecture and self-attention mechanisms, similar to those in large language models, to directly generate the most probable chemical structures that match the input spectroscopic data. Trained on ~ 102 k IR, UV, and 1H NMR spectra, it performs structural elucidation of molecules with up to 29 atoms in just a few seconds on a modern CPU, achieving a top-15 accuracy of 83%. This approach demonstrates the potential of transformer based generative AI to accelerate traditional scientific problem-solving processes. The model's ability to iterate quickly based on new data highlights its potential for rapid advancements in structural elucidation. Scientific Contribution: This study introduces a transformer-based generative AI model as a novel approach to structural elucidation for organic compounds, replacing traditional CASE systems with an end-to-end encoder-decoder architecture.

"Accurate skin lesion segmentation is an important task in dermatology for facilitating early diagnosis and treatment planning. The challenges in skin lesion segmentation comprehend the variability in lesion, low contrast, heterogeneous backgrounds, overlapping or connected lesions, noise and certain artifacts. Despite of these challenges, Deep learning models accomplish remarkable results for skin lesion segmentation by automatically learning discriminative features. The current research introduces a novel approach utilizing the ASSP-based Deeplabv3+ for skin lesion segmentation along with other UNET-based learners while employing VGG-16, VGG-19 and Dense nets as encoders. In addition, an analysis is conducted on GAN-UNET to evaluate the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence in generating segmented images of skin lesions. Three benchmark medical image datasets, namely ISIC-2016, ISIC-2018, and HAM10000 Lesion Boundary Segmentation, are used to evaluate all five models. The models are trained exclusively on the ISIC-2018 dataset. A comparative analysis is performed, comparing the performance of these models against state-of-the-art segmentation methods, focusing on standard computer vision metrics.

"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has developed as an effective tool for time series predicting, revolutionizing the typical methods of prediction. Different classical approaches that depend on existing approaches and assumptions, generative AI controls advanced deep learning (DL) approaches like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to identify designs and connections in time series data. DL has accomplished major success in optimizing performances connected with AI. In the financial area, it can be extremely utilized for the stock market predictive, trade implementation approaches, and set of optimizers. Stock market predictive is the most important use case in this field. GANs with advanced AI approaches have become more significant in recent times. However, it can be utilized in image‐image‐translation and other computer vision (CV) conditions. GANs could not utilized greatly for stock market prediction because of their effort to establish the proper set of hyperparameters. This study develops an integrated spotted hyena optimization algorithm with generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting (SHOAGAI‐TSF) technique. The purpose of the SHOAGAI‐TSF technique is to accomplish a forecasting process for the utilization of stock price prediction. The SHOAGAI‐TSF technique uses probabilistic forecasting with a conditional GAN (CGAN) approach for the prediction of stock prices. The CGAN model learns the data generation distribution and determines the probabilistic prediction from it.

"The implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has the potential to unleash the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). However, integrating GAI with IoT introduces a significant challenge in managing the limited resources of edge networks. In this article, we propose a resource optimization framework for GAI in IoT systems to address this issue, leveraging a heterogeneous computing framework. We focus on the system utility maximization problem, which jointly optimizes transmit power, heterogeneous computing allocation, CPU-cycle frequency, GPU-cycle frequency, and task scheduling under the latency constraint. The optimal CPU-cycle frequency, GPU-cycle frequency, and computing allocation are obtained by employing data parallelism analysis. In particular, we develop a hierarchical soft actor-critic with an intrinsic curiosity (HSAC-IC) algorithm to determine the task scheduling strategy. The HSAC-IC algorithm utilizes a hierarchical strategy structure and an intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) to improve learning efficiency and performance, particularly in environments characterized by sparse rewards, high-dimensional action spaces, and complex tasks. Our simulations benchmark the HSAC-IC algorithm against two existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and three reference schemes. The results illustrate that our scheme significantly outperforms these alternatives, ensuring AIGC user service requirements, while minimizing service generation costs, and optimizing resource allocation by configuring the image quality strategy on edge servers.","Feng, J.; Huang, X.; Liu, L.; Yang, M.; Pei, Q.; Shee, Y.G.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JIOT.2025.3542473,ibqk44ji7f,,,10,"IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, IEEE Internet Things J.",,13247,13233,,True,20250515,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Resource management; Internet of Things; Computational modeling; Servers; Radio spectrum management; Optimization; Image edge detection; Graphics processing units; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Energy consumption; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (GAI); hierarchical soft actor-critic with an intrinsic curiosity (HSAC-IC); Internet of Things (IoT); resource optimization",Resource Allocation for Task-Oriented Generative Artificial Intelligence in Internet of Things,12
"The integration of federated learning (FL) with the Internet of Things (IoT) represents an advanced technological trend, combining the extensive connectivity of IoT with the powerful processing capabilities of FL to drive innovation and optimization across multiple domains. Given the heterogeneity of IoT devices and the variability in data distribution, developing strategies to enhance FL performance without overly burdening resource-constrained devices is crucial. This article proposes an FL algorithm based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) for IoT devices with extreme heterogeneity in data and resources. The algorithm utilizes pretrained GAI models to generate new data, aligning the data distributions of individual IoT devices closer to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thereby effectively reducing the heterogeneity of local data. Additionally, the proposed algorithm incorporates data synthesis and resource scheduling strategies to mitigate the heterogeneity of local device resources. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while maximizing FL performance. Experimental results demonstrate that, under significant resource and data distribution disparities, most existing solutions struggle to converge, whereas the proposed method converges and achieves superior performance. Compared to existing GAI-based approaches, our method significantly reduces latency and energy consumption.","Meng, Z.; Li, Z.; Hou, X.; Xu, M.; Xia, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Song, S.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/JIOT.2024.3521017,jqshx7hyzr,,,10,"IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Internet of Things Journal, IEEE, IEEE Internet Things J.",,13296,13286,,True,20250515,IEEE,"Computing and Processing; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Internet of Things; Data models; Federated learning; Distributed databases; Data collection; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Training; Optimization; Horses; Computational modeling; Federated learning (FL); <mark>generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> (GAI); Internet of Things (IoT); resource allocation",Enhancing Federated Learning Performance on Heterogeneous IoT Devices Using Generative Artificial Intelligence With Resource Scheduling,12

"Semantic Communication (SC) is an emerging technology aiming to surpass the Shannon limit. Traditional SC strategies often minimize signal distortion between the original and reconstructed data, neglecting perceptual quality, especially in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Generative AI Semantic Communication (GSC) system for single-user scenarios. This system leverages deep generative models to establish a new paradigm in SC. Specifically, At the transmitter end, it employs a joint source-channel coding mechanism based on the Swin Transformer for efficient semantic feature extraction and compression. At the receiver end, an advanced Diffusion Model (DM) reconstructs high-quality images from degraded signals, enhancing perceptual details. Additionally, we present a Multi-User Generative Semantic Communication (MU-GSC) system utilizing an asynchronous processing model. This model effectively manages multiple user requests and optimally utilizes system resources for parallel processing. Simulation results on public datasets demonstrate that our generative AI semantic communication systems achieve superior transmission efficiency and enhanced communication content quality across various channel conditions. Compared to CNN-based DeepJSCC, our methods improve the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by 17.75% in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels and by 20.84% in Rayleigh channels.","Zhang, K.; Li, L.; Lin, W.; Yan, Y.; Li, R.; Cheng, W.; Han, Z.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2025.3526839,uhhtwe5cvf,,,2,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) in edge networks has excelled in delivering human-level creative services close to the end users. However, providing customized intelligence services to a wide range of end clients remains challenging due to the diverse demands of edge applications. In this paper, we present FlexGen, an efficient generative AI framework with flexible diffusion models, to tailor the intelligence service for different client-side requests under diverse quality and efficiency constraints. To this end, we first design and train a flexible diffusion model to support quality-and-cost adjustable image synthesis. After that, we focus on the server-side energy minimization problem subject to the quality level of generative service and the client-side latency constraint. We further theoretically characterize the relationship between the width of the diffusion model and the expected quality of the synthetic image. Following that, the decomposition solution is applied to optimize the generative service, where the image synthesis strategy and resource allocation policy are personalized for different client-side requests. Experiments indicate that, compared to existing image generation schemes, our framework can save up to two times energy consumption without sacrificing the quality of the service.","Li, P.; Dong, H.; Qian, L.; Zhou, S.; Wu, Y.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2024.3522084,qzf4kkf4kj,,,2,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"Radio map is an efficient demonstration for visually displaying the wireless signal coverage within a certain region. It has been considered to be increasingly helpful for the future sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, as wireless nodes are becoming more crowded and complicated. However, the construction of high resolution radio map is very challenging due to the sparse sampling in practical systems. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable to create synthetic data to fill in gaps in real-world measurements, is an effective technique to construct high precision radio maps. Currently, generative models for radio map construction are trained with two-dimension (2D) single band radio maps in urban scenario, which has poor generalization in diverse terrain scenarios, spectrum bands, and heights. To tackle this problem, we provide a multiband three-dimension (3D) radio map dataset with consideration of terrain and climate information, named SpectrumNet. It is the largest radio map dataset in terms of dimensions and scale, which contains the radio map of 3 spacial dimensions, 5 frequency bands, 11 terrain scenarios, and 3 climate scenarios. We introduce the parameters and settings for the SpectrumNet dataset generation, and evaluate four baseline methods for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet dataset. Experiments show the necessity of the SpectrumNet dataset for training models with strong generalization in spacial, frequency, and terrain scenario domains. Future works on the SpectrumNet dataset are also discussed, including the dataset expansion and calibration, as well as the extended studies on generative models for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet dataset.","Zhang, S.; Jiang, S.; Lin, W.; Fang, Z.; Liu, K.; Zhang, H.; Chen, K.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2024.3502492,w2orwume7r,,,2,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"This study examines the use of AI tools within work environments, particularly Generative AI (Gen-AI). Its objective is to comprehend the factors affecting employees' adoption and utilization of such tools. The research applies the Technology, Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework to pinpoint potential factors and formulate hypotheses regarding their influence on employees' Gen-AI usage frequency. A quantitative research approach was conducted among a sample of 316 American employees. Results suggest that employees' perceived Gen-AI intelligence and warmth positively impact their usage through the mediation of performance expectancy. Effort expectancy only mediates the relationship between perceived Gen-AI intelligence and Gen-AI employee usage. Findings also show that the perceived severity of Gen-AI has a negative influence on employees' usage and that an organization's absorptive capacity of Gen-AI does not influence employees' usage.

"The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the deployment of edge computing infrastructures have significantly advanced data processing and network communications. Federated Learning (FL), leveraging these developments, offers a decentralized approach to learning across edge devices while preserving local privacy. However, traditional FL paradigms encounter challenges related to non-IID data distributions, diverse computational capabilities of edge devices, and multimodal tasks. This paper proposes a novel Dual-Circulation Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) framework for Clustered Federated Learning (GAI-CFL), designed to address multi-granularity heterogeneity including data, resources, and task heterogeneity. The GAI-CFL framework integrates Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies to optimize data generation and resource allocation processes. GAI techniques are employed to reduce intra-cluster data heterogeneity by generating data, thereby enriching local datasets and enhancing model convergence. To address inter-cluster data and task heterogeneity, a dual-circulation optimization strategy is implemented, utilizing RL with GDMs to generate optimal strategies based on input data characteristics dynamically. Additionally, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach is incorporated within GDMs to select the best expert models for denoising steps, ensuring efficient data generation strategies. Comprehensive simulations clarify that the proposed GAI-CFL framework significantly presents benchmark schemes, achieving lower energy consumption and enhanced system performance under the same delay and performance constraints.","He, W.; Yao, H.; Ren, X.; Ouyang, T.; Xiong, Z.; He, Y.; Liu, Y.",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/TCCN.2025.3542862,hmamecqdxj,,,2,"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on, IEEE Trans.

"The authors' central premise is that a human–LLM (large language model) hybrid approach leads to efficiency and effectiveness gains in the marketing research process. In qualitative research, they show that LLMs can assist in both data generation and analysis; LLMs effectively create sample characteristics, generate synthetic respondents, and conduct and moderate in-depth interviews. The AI–human hybrid generates information-rich, coherent data that surpasses human-only data in depth and insightfulness and matches human performance in data analysis tasks of generating themes and summaries. Evidence from expert judges shows that humans and LLMs possess complementary skills; the human–LLM hybrid outperforms its human-only or LLM-only counterpart. For quantitative research, the LLM correctly picks the answer direction and valence, with the quality of synthetic data significantly improving through few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation. The authors demonstrate the value of the AI–human hybrid by collaborating with a Fortune 500 food company and replicating a 2019 qualitative and quantitative study using GPT-4. For their empirical investigation, the authors design the system architecture and prompts to create personas, ask questions, and obtain responses from synthetic respondents.

"Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing financial security, a sense of identity and purpose, and social integration. Job insecurity, underemployment and unemployment are well-documented risk factors for mental health issues and suicide. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job displacement and its corollary impacts on individual and social wellbeing. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour underutilisation and demand in the economy using Australian data as a case study. Results indicate that even a moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6–31.8%), and decrease the consumption index by 21% (95% interval, 13.6–28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary. Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital-to-labour ratio threshold beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study underscores the need for cross-sectoral government measures to ensure a smooth transition to an AI-dominated economy to safeguard the Mental Wealth of nations.","Occhipinti, Jo-An; Hynes, William; Prodan, Ante; Eyre, Harris; Green, Roy; Burrow, Sharan; Tanner, Marcel; Buchanan, John; Ujdur, Goran; Destrebecq, Frederic; Song, Christine; Carnevale, Steven; Hickie, Ian B.; Heffernan, Mark",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.1038/s41598-025-08498-x,7od7tar6uj,,,1,Scientific Reports,,11,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=7od7tar6uj&recordId=7od7tar6uj&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250718,Springer Nature,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Job security; Economic equilibrium; Economic development; Mental health; Intervention (Federal government); Offices of Mental Health Practitioners (except Physicians),Generative AI may create a socioeconomic tipping point through labour displacement.,15
"Generative artificial intelligence (gAI) tools and large language models (LLMs) are gaining popularity among non-specialist audiences (patients, caregivers, and the general public) as a source of plain language medical information. AI-based models have the potential to act as a convenient, customizable and easy-to-access source of information that can improve patients' self-care and health literacy and enable greater engagement with clinicians. However, serious negative outcomes could occur if these tools fail to provide reliable, relevant and understandable medical information. Herein, we review published findings on opportunities and risks associated with such use of gAI/LLMs. We reviewed 44 articles published between January 2023 and July 2024. From the included articles, we find a focus on readability and accuracy; however, only three studies involved actual patients. Responses were reported to be reasonably accurate and sufficiently readable and detailed. The most commonly reported risks were oversimplification, over-generalization, lower accuracy in response to complex questions, and lack of transparency regarding information sources. There are ethical concerns that overreliance/unsupervised reliance on gAI/LLMs could lead to the ""humanizing"" of these models and pose a risk to patient health equity, inclusiveness and data privacy. For these technologies to be truly transformative, they must become more transparent, have appropriate governance and monitoring, and incorporate feedback from healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients, and other experts. Uptake of these technologies will also need education and awareness among non-specialist audiences around their optimal use as sources of plain language medical information. Plain Language Summary: More and more people are using special computer programs called artificial intelligence (AI) or large language models (LLMs) to find and get medical facts in simple words they can understand. This can help people take better care of themselves, learn about their health, and talk with their doctors. We found that AI/LLMs generally provided correct and helpful information to people. However, there could also be a risk of incorrect or unreliable information in certain situations if the question is complex. This can cause harm to people if they use this information to make their own medical decisions. Also, gAI/LLMs provide human-like responses, which make people trust them more than they should. There could be a risk that people may share their medical information with AI/LLMs, which could get into the wrong hands. To make sure these programs really help people, they need to be clear about how they work, and they must have good rules to follow and take advice from doctors and patients to improve performance. People also need to be trained on how to best use these AI tools to find easy-to-understand and reliable medical information. It is important for doctors, patients and other health workers to help make sure the AI is producing reliable and understandable medical information for patients.","Pal, Avishek; Wangmo, Tenzin; Bharadia, Trishna; Ahmed-Richards, Mithi; Bhanderi, Mayank Bhailalbhai; Kachhadiya, Rohitbhai; Allemann, Samuel S; Elger, Bernice Simone",Academic Search Ultimate,,10.2147/PPA.S527922,5qlm7qbx6b,,,,Patient Preference &amp; Adherence,,2249,2227,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=5qlm7qbx6b&recordId=5qlm7qbx6b&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250701,Dove Medical Press Ltd,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Language models; Ethics; Possibility; Health literacy; Patient participation; Hazards,"Generative AI/LLMs for Plain Language Medical Information for Patients, Caregivers and General Public: Opportunities, Risks and Ethics.",19
"With the wide application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology in society, GenAI literacy and critical thinking are considered vital competencies for success in the future. As future teachers, pre-service teachers (PSTs) must possess these key competencies. Previous research has pointed out that although learning and applying GenAI knowledge and technology can improve PSTs' GenAI literacy, the results were not as expected. This study incorporated a KWL (Know, Want, Learned)-based reflection strategy based on the SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer) model, and proposed an RSCQA (Reflection, Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer) approach, which aims to help PSTs develop GenAI literacy and critical thinking. A quasi-experiment was designed for this study to verify the validity of the RSCQA approach, which was used by the experimental group, while the Conventional SCQA (CSCQA) approach was used by the control group. Results of the study demonstrated that using the RSCQA approach improved PSTs' GenAI literacy and critical thinking, and they excelled in multimodal demonstration capability. This study also conducted an ENA analysis of the content of PSTs' reflections, and the results demonstrated that reflective strategies help PSTs engage in higher-order cognitive activities. The results of the qualitative interviews further indicated that the reflective strategy enhanced PSTs' learning effectiveness and strengthened their critical thinking. Overall, the RSCQA approach helps PSTs engage in reflective learning and perform better in GenAI literacy and critical thinking.

"Read just about any business history and you realize just how much a firm's success depends on its culture. Without the right culture, you can't have successful innovation. You can't compete successfully. You can't thrive over the long term. So, if you want to lead your organization into a future that features generative artificial intelligence, you need to build the right culture for it. Nitin Mittal, leader of Deloitte's global AI business and coauthor of All-In on AI, and Tsedal Neeley, Harvard Business School professor and coauthor of The Digital Mindset, share their thoughts on how companies can adopt generative AI effectively and ethically. They discuss the risks, such as perpetuating harmful biases; the challenges, such as ensuring that workers are learning, reskilling, and not being left behind; and emerging best practices of adapting organizational culture to generative AI. Mittal underscores the need for personal accountability in generative AI usage because ""no AI system is going to magically somehow be responsible for itself."" Yet this sense of accountability must be supported by a company framework of guidelines, protocols, and methods in terms of what to think and when and how to apply those methods. Neeley adds that ""timeless"" leadership skills around integrity, accountability, and fairness will be just as vital as technical skills in creating a ""responsible-AI-use culture""—determining the safeguards for usage and encouraging and teaching employees how to use gen AI tools to get the best possible results from them.",,Business Source Ultimate,,,wcrssmc3sz,,,,Harvard Business Review,,33,26,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=wcrssmc3sz&recordId=wcrssmc3sz&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,False,20241201,Harvard University,"Corporate culture; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> in business; Leadership; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Mittal, Nitin; Neeley, Tsedal",How Generative AI Changes Organizational Culture.,102
"Artificial intelligence (AI) as a disruptive technology is not new. However, its recent evolution, engineered by technological transformation, big data analytics, and quantum computing, produces conversational and generative AI (CGAI/GenAI) and human‐like chatbots that disrupt conventional operations and methods in different fields. This study investigates the scientific landscape of CGAI and human–chatbot interaction/collaboration and evaluates use cases, benefits, challenges, and policy implications for multidisciplinary education and allied industry operations. The publications trend showed that just 4% (n = 75) occurred during 2006–2018, while 2019–2023 experienced astronomical growth (n = 1763 or 96%). The prominent use cases of CGAI (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching, learning, and research activities occurred in computer science (multidisciplinary and AI; 32%), medical/healthcare (17%), engineering (7%), and business fields (6%). The intellectual structure shows strong collaboration among eminent multidisciplinary sources in business, information systems, and other areas. The thematic structure highlights prominent CGAI use cases, including improved user experience in human–computer interaction, computer programs/code generation, and systems creation. Widespread CGAI usefulness for teachers, researchers, and learners includes syllabi/course content generation, testing aids, and academic writing. The concerns about abuse and misuse (plagiarism, academic integrity, privacy violations) and issues about misinformation, danger of self‐diagnoses, and patient privacy in medical/healthcare applications are prominent. Formulating strategies and policies to address potential CGAI challenges in teaching/learning and practice are priorities. Developing discipline‐based automatic detection of GenAI contents to check abuse is proposed. In operational/operations research areas, proper CGAI/GenAI integration with modeling and decision support systems requires further studies.","Akpan, Ikpe Justice; Kobara, Yawo M.; Owolabi, Josiah; Akpan, Asuama A.; Offodile, Onyebuchi Felix",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1111/itor.13522,c2ea2wcjpn,,,3,International Transactions in Operational Research,,1281,1251,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=c2ea2wcjpn&recordId=c2ea2wcjpn&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250501,Wiley-Blackwell,"Decision support systems; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Computer science; Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology); Research and development in the  physical, engineering and life sciences; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Chatbots",Conversational and generative artificial intelligence and human–chatbot interaction in education and research.,32
"ABSTRACT Generating strategic foresight for public organizations is a resource‐intensive and non‐trivial effort. Strategic foresight is especially important for governments, which are increasingly confronted by complex and unpredictable challenges and wicked problems. With advances in machine learning, information systems can be integrated more creatively into the strategic foresight process. We report on an innovative pilot project conducted by an Australian state government that leveraged generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models, for strategic foresight using a design science approach. The project demonstrated AI's potential to enhance scenario generation for strategic foresight, improve data processing efficiency, and support human decision‐making. However, the study also found that it is essential to balance AI automation with human expertise for validation and oversight. These findings highlight the importance of iterative design to develop robust AI tools for strategic foresight which, alongside stakeholder engagement and process transparency, build trust and ensure practical relevance.","Picavet, Marc E.

"This study examines the implementation pathway of Generative AI Capabilities (GAIC) in manufacturing organisations, focusing on the roles of organisational creativity and green innovation ambidexterity in achieving a green competitive advantage. Drawing on the Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) framework, this research develops and empirically tests an integrated model using data collected from 297 senior and middle-level managers of manufacturing firms in Taiwan. The results indicate that both technological and organisational contexts have a significant influence on GAIC implementation, whereas the environmental context shows no significant impact. Furthermore, GAIC demonstrates significant positive effects on both organisational creativity and green innovation ambidexterity, which in turn enhances green competitive advantage. This study addresses critical research gaps by making several contributions by extending the TOE framework to encompass GAIC, thereby advancing the understanding of human-AI collaborative creativity.

"The rapid evolution of cyber-attacks has significantly increased the demand for improved cybersecurity defenses. Large enterprises are increasingly relying on various attack detection systems and cyber threat intelligence to detect attacks and introduce a robust strategy against malicious attacks. However, this also has its limitations i.e., cybersecurity professionals require a lot of time to analyze the attacks detected by an intrusion detection system (IDS) and generate appropriate reports. Therefore, we need to automate this process to improve efficiency. Generative AI plays a crucial role in generating efficient automated reports. Large Language Models (LLMs) in Generative AI, which can be tuned to complex datasets, have demonstrated their capabilities in various applications that use transformers such as image-to-text, text-to-image, and text generation. In this paper, we propose a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)-based intrusion detection system (IDS) that combines honeypots, machine learning-based IDS, and LLMs in combination with a knowledge graph. Specifically, we use fine-tuned pre-trained models on custom datasets based on CVE information.

"The principles of easy-to-read (E2R) materials are crucial for individuals with disabilities, as they simplify language, provide clear structures, and use user-friendly designs to reduce the difficulty in understanding information. These principles help individuals overcome barriers to comprehending important content. Online friendships have become a common form of social interaction in today's society; providing easy-to-understand online safety knowledge to people with disabilities has become an important issue in public health and social participation. However, existing educational resources are often insufficient, and developing materials that adhere to E2R principles requires significant time and resources. To address the challenge of insufficient resources, the study introduces generative AI technology to rapidly and effectively create educational materials that comply with E2R principles to meet the learning needs of individuals with disabilities regarding online friendship safety. This study examines the performance of three generative AI models—GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro—in developing educational materials based on E2R principles, specifically tailored to provide appropriate online safety knowledge for individuals with disabilities. The research was conducted in two stages: the first stage evaluated the AI models' ability to generate basic knowledge.In contrast, the second stage assessed their ability to integrate E2R principles into generating educational materials. The evaluation used statistical methods, including the Wilcox-on and Kruskal-Wallis tests, to determine each AI model's outcomes in both stages. The results showed that GPT-4o performed best across both stages, consistently generating complete and coherent knowledge and materials. Claude-3.5-sonnet followed closely, with some fluctuations but overall stable performance. Gemini-1.5-pro performed the worst, producing unstable content with significant variability. The findings of this study are significant, as they indicate that GPT-4o is the most suitable AI model for developing easy-to-read educational materials, whether for basic knowledge generation or for integrating external E2R resources to create online friendship safety materials. This research provides empirical evidence and design recommendations that can guide the future use of AI technology in creating educational materials tailored to vulnerable groups.","Huang, HanChun; Chuang, Hsiao Wen",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICOT64290.2024.10936939,3uddufyvln,,,,"2024 International Conference on Orange Technology (ICOT), Orange Technology (ICOT), 2024 International Conference on",,5,1,,True,20241215,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Fluctuations; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Statistical analysis; Knowledge acquisition; People with disabilities; Safety; Social implications of technology; Public healthcare; Disabilities; Easy-to-Read; Online friendship",Assessing the Effectiveness of Easy-to-Read Principles in Different Generative AI Models: Enhancing Knowledge Acquisition for People with Disabilities,

"Generative AI is emerging as a disruptive force in the healthcare industry, bringing novel solutions ranging from drug development and clinical decision support to personalized patient care. This study is focused on drug discovery using the Generative AI model. In this paper, a system is proposed for providing drug descriptions from drug pill images. The system is implemented by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in combination with computer vision to detect and provide detailed information about drugs from pill images. In the proposed system, the identification process begins by taking the medicinal drug pills and their cover images. Then, the image is converted into binary values using a standard built-in function. In addition, the target language for providing audio descriptions about the drugs is also used. Then, the Google Gemini LLM model is customized by using binary values of the image, target language, and ontology-based prompt engineering. As a result, the LLM model provides drug descriptions in text. Then, the textual description of the drug is converted into the target language audio format by using the Google Text to Speech Converter. The system is experimented by using 807 medicinal drug images which are collected from web resources. The performance of the system is measured by using accuracy. The system achieved an accuracy of 95.04% which is a little higher when compared with the current state-of-the-art model.","R, Menaha; R, Abilaash; N, Mohanram P; Unnikrishnan, Akash; S, Sukumar",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/ICERCS63125.2024.10895371,baxelmkodf,,,,"2024 International Conference on Emerging Research in Computational Science (ICERCS), Emerging Research in Computational Science (ICERCS), 2024 International Conference on",,5,1,,True,20241212,IEEE,"Bioengineering; Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Computing and Processing; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Drugs; Accuracy; Text analysis; Computational modeling; System performance; Medical services; Streaming media; Internet; Text to speech; Biomedical imaging; Drug Pill Identification; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Large Language Models; Pharmaceutical Image Analysis; Multimodal Learning; Medical Text Analysis",Drug Pills Identification System using Google Gemini LLM: A Generative AI approach,

"Research has shown that learning through quiz creation, where learners generate their own quizzes, demands a more profound understanding than learning through quiz-solving. Consequently, it is anticipated to yield greater learning outcomes. However, conventional support systems for learning through quiz creation have demonstrated that the learning outcomes vary depending on the process when learners are responsible for creating the quizzes. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the flexibility of the quiz creation is reduced when the process is streamlined and regulated. To effectively address these issues, we must clarify the quiz creation process to deepen understanding and encourage it in accordance with the process. Moreover, to facilitate the flexible quiz creation and promote a quiz creation process that enhances understanding, we focused on using an interactive generative artificial intelligence (AI). We first analyze the quiz creation process by focusing on three common types: story-based, quiz-based, and solution-based. Additionally, we develop generative AI prompts to facilitate the process. Subsequently, we conducted an experimental application of the generative AI with the designed prompts to university students. The results of the experimental application indicate that the proposed quiz creation process partially contributed to enhancing comprehension through quiz creation, and our approach successfully improved learning outcomes.

"The surging development of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) marks a transformative era of the content creation and production. Edge servers promise attractive benefits, e.g., reduced service delay and backhaul traffic load, for hosting AIGC services compared to cloud-based solutions. However, the scarcity of available resources on the edge pose significant challenges in deploying generative AI models. In this paper, by characterizing the resource and delay demands of typical generative AI models, we find that the consumption of storage and GPU memory, as well as the model switching delay represented by I/O delay during the preloading phase, are significant and vary across models. These multidimensional coupling factors render it difficult to make efficient edge model deployment decisions. Hence, we present a collaborative edge-cloud framework aiming to properly manage generative AI model deployment on the edge. Specifically, we formulate edge model deployment problem considering heterogeneous features of models as an optimization problem, and propose a model-level decision selection algorithm to solve it. It enables pooled resource sharing and optimizes the trade-off between resource consumption and delay in edge generative AI model deployment. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared with baselines, demonstrating its potential to reduce overall costs by providing feature-aware model deployment decisions.","Liang, Yuxin; Yang, Peng; He, Yuanyuan; Lyu, Feng",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/GLOBECOM52923.2024.10901571,i4e63h7ozf,,,,"GLOBECOM 2024 - 2024 IEEE Global Communications Conference, Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2024 - 2024 IEEE",,2652,2647,,True,20241208,IEEE,"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies; Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems; Power, Energy and Industry Applications; Signal Processing and Analysis; Adaptation models; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Simulation; Collaboration; Telecommunication traffic; Switches; Delays; Servers; Resource management; Load modeling",Resource-Efficient Generative AI Model Deployment in Mobile Edge Networks,

"Since the launch of ChatGPT, Generative AI (GenAI) has transformed virtually every domain, addressing complex problems in areas previously considered insurmountable. At the same time, the adoption of cloud computing for storing confidential data has been rapidly increasing. This swift shift to the cloud has highlighted the critical need for robust data protection measures. In this paper, we merge these two emerging fields to examine how GenAI influences cloud data security. While research on traditional AI-based solutions for cyber threats has been ongoing, the recent surge in GenAI adoption calls for a focused, systematic study to address specific research questions related to GenAI. We formulate 7 research questions and analyze data from 4 major digital repositories (IEEE, Springer, ACM, Wiley) to provide an extensive overview of how GenAI contributes to mitigating key cloud security threats such as Malware, Denial-Of-Service (DoS), and Phishing, among others. We also discuss the potential risks posed by GenAI in cloud security and highlight the operational and ethical challenges that impede its widespread adoption.

"Grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory and Distributed Cognition Theory, this study investigates the mechanism through which teachers’ transformational leadership influences college students’ employability in the context of generative artificial intelligence. Employing a stratified cluster sampling approach, questionnaire data were collected from 311 undergraduates across two universities in Zhejiang Province. The findings reveal that students’ perceived teachers’ transformational leadership not only directly and positively influences their employability but also exerts indirect effects through three distinct pathways: the single mediating role of problem-based learning, the single mediating role of self-efficacy, and the chain mediating role of problem-based learning and self-efficacy. Furthermore, a moderated chain mediation model demonstrates that higher levels of generative artificial intelligence usage among students strengthen the chain mediating effect of problem-based learning and self-efficacy in the relationship between perceived teachers’ transformational leadership and employability. These results elucidate the intrinsic mechanism by which teachers’ transformational leadership impacts college students’ employability empowered by generative artificial intelligence and extend the application of Social Cognitive Career Theory and Distributed Cognition Theory within the domain of employability research.","Zhang, Jiping",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s10639-025-13798-w,27rdanojxr,,,,Education and Information Technologies: The Official Journal of the IFIP Technical Committee on Education,,32,1,,True,20251007,Springer US,Teachers’ transformational leadership; Employability; Problem-based learning; Self-efficacy; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark> usage,The impact of teachers’ transformational leadership on college students’ employability in the context of generative artificial intelligence: A study based on social cognitive career theory and distributed cognition theory,
"This study addresses the limitations of traditional STEM education by integrating socio-scientific issues within the STEM-5E instructional framework, using generative AI-driven scaffolding for self-regulated learning (GAISSR). We investigated how different types of GAISSR affect students' argumentation performance over time and how students’ epistemic beliefs about generative AI (GenAI) relate to their improvement in argumentation skills. Ninety-four eighth-grade students participated, randomly assigned to metacognitive GAISSR, cognitive GAISSR, or a control group. The curriculum involved three consecutive tasks on energy policy issues related to climate change. A linear mixed model was used to analyze changes in students' argumentation performance over time, while epistemic beliefs and self-regulation were assessed via adapted questionnaires. Findings revealed a significant interaction between scaffolding type and task sequence; cognitive scaffolding initially improved performance but did not sustain gains, whereas metacognitive scaffolding supported continued improvement by the final task. Additionally, students who demonstrated improvement reported significantly stronger beliefs in the certainty, source, and structural coherence of GenAI-generated content compared to peers who did not improve. These results suggest metacognitive scaffolding promotes deeper, enduring argumentation skills, and students’ epistemic beliefs about GenAI significantly influence their learning outcomes.","Sui, Chi-Jung; Chang, Chun-Yen; Yen, Miao-Hsuan",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s10956-025-10257-6,w3bv3bthzb,,,,Journal of Science Education and Technology,,19,1,,True,20251001,Springer Netherlands,SSI; Argumentation; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Epistemic beliefs,STEM-5E Socio-Scientific Argumentation with Generative AI-Driven Scaffolding: Exploring the Interplay between Epistemic Beliefs and Learning Outcomes,
"Governance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) involves two interrelated dimensions: the substantive tools used to guide AI development and deployment and the institutional structures through which those tools are designed, implemented, and enforced. This paper develops an emergent order approach to these questions, informed by Austrian economic arguments regarding decentralized coordination and subsequent work on perverse emergent orders and knowledge commons governance. Generative AI has developed through decentralized experimentation, bottom-up collaboration, and evolving norms, displaying the adaptive, innovative qualities of a beneficial emergent order or knowledge commons. Yet generative AI can amplify “perverse” emergent orders, from conspiracy networks and electoral manipulation to racist mobilization and violent militias, by lowering the cost of persuasive content, expanding its reach, and reinforcing destructive dynamics. Effective governance must therefore sustain AI’s innovation-friendly environment while constraining its role in harmful emergent systems.

"Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), this evaluates the effects of generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) on learning performance within China's education sector, emphasizing the roles of social interaction, utilitarian benefit, knowledge acquisition, and epistemic curiosity. The study employs a dual method, using PLS-SEM and fsQCA approaches for data analysis. Data were collected through an online questionnaire from students and teachers from Chinese institutes. The findings suggest that students and teachers have positive opinions on the influence of Gen-AI on learning performance through social interaction and knowledge acquisition. Utilitarian benefits positively mediate the affiliation between Gen-AI and teachers' learning performance, but in the case of students, they negatively mediate. Furthermore, epistemic curiosity acts as a positive moderator between Gen-AI technologies and social interaction and knowledge acquisition, but it has a negative relationship with Gen-AI technologies and utilitarian benefits. Furthermore, the fsQCA analysis reveals robust configurations with high consistency, explaining learning performance outcomes reliably and highlighting significant and unique contributions of specific configurations. The implications of this study emphasize how crucial generative AI technologies are in educational frameworks to optimize their potential benefits and enhance learning outcomes in China's quickly changing educational landscape.","Shahzad, Muhammad Farrukh; Xu, Shuo; An, Xin; Asif, Muhammad; Javed, Iqra",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s10639-025-13528-2,ni6muxwm2b,,,14,Education and Information Technologies: The Official Journal of the IFIP Technical Committee on Education,,19676,19647,,True,20250901,Springer US,Epistemic curiosity; Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark> technologies; Knowledge acquisition; Learning performance; Social interaction,Do generative AI technologies play a double-edged sword role in education?

"The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 marked the beginning of a rapid transformation in higher education, soon followed by the development of multimodal generative AI programs. As this technology becomes increasingly integrated into teaching and learning, it is crucial to evaluate its current use and impact. This systematic literature review captures the initial academic response to generative AI, providing insights into how higher education has adopted this transformative technology in its first two years. The findings indicate that while some themes from the pre-ChatGPT era persist, new and emerging trends—particularly in fostering creativity, critical thinking, learning autonomy, and prompt literacy—are now taking shape. This shift underscores a growing emphasis on the pedagogical integration of generative AI. However, the review also highlights a key tension: while generative AI enhances efficiency, it raises concerns about overreliance, potentially leading to the outsourcing of critical cognitive and metacognitive skills. To address these challenges and fully harness the potential of generative AI, future research should focus on exploring multimodal generative AI tools and fostering student–teacher-AI collaboration.","Qian, Yufeng",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s11528-025-01100-1,nw2xpcaliv,,,5,TechTrends: Linking Research and Practice to Improve LearningA publication of the Association for Educational Communications &amp; Technology,,1120,1105,,True,20250901,Springer US,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Teaching and learning; Higher education; Systematic literature review,Pedagogical Applications of Generative AI in Higher Education: A Systematic Review of the Field,69
"This study investigates the short-term impact of generative AI, exemplified by the introduction of ChatGPT, on user contributions in a coding Q&amp;A platform. We find that the introduction of ChatGPT led to a reduction in the number of high-quality answers provided by users, particularly among highly engaged contributors, despite an overall increase in answers. We identify two key mechanisms: (1) increased perceived question sophistication despite no actual change in content and (2) reduced motivation of loyal users in providing answers in the face of AI-generated alternatives. The findings suggest that while generative AI can facilitate value creation on user-generated content (UGC) platforms, it also poses challenges in retaining core contributors and managing content quality. The paper contributes to the literature on the impact of AI adoption on platforms and suggests practical implications for UGC platform management, such as the need for AI content disclosure measures to retain engaged users.","Li, Xinyu; Kim, Keongtae",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s11002-024-09747-1,uo26orv5fz,,,3,Marketing Letters: A Journal of Research in Marketing,,591,577,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=uo26orv5fz&recordId=onayklj53f&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250901,Springer US,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; User contribution; UGC platform; Content policy,Impacts of generative AI on user contributions: evidence from a coding Q &amp;A platform,36
"Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence for visualization offer significant opportunities to develop instructional materials. These opportunities can benefit astronomy education, which frequently relies on visual aids like representations. This document analysis study investigates ChatGPT-4o’s capabilities for creating and evaluating visual representations for astronomy education. Initially, ChatGPT-4o was utilized to create representations illustrating the phases of the Moon. These visuals were then evaluated based on predefined criteria, focusing on iconic features for reading and interpreting the representation. Subsequently, existing visuals on the same topic were provided to ChatGPT-4o, and it was asked to evaluate these visuals using the same predefined criteria. Finally, the assessments were compared with ChatGPT-4o’s evaluations. Findings suggest that while ChatGPT-4o-generated visual representations often contain inaccuracies that are potentially misleading for students, ChatGPT-4o effectively evaluates the iconic features to read and interpret the representations. This underscores the potential utility of generative artificial intelligence as a critical tool in ensuring the quality of visual representations in science education. It is recommended to integrate advanced artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT-4o into the evaluation processes for instructional materials.","Okulu, Hasan Zuhtu",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s10639-025-13580-y,sb7mzoyw6n,,,14,Education and Information Technologies: The Official Journal of the IFIP Technical Committee on Education,,19852,19833,,True,20250901,Springer US,<mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; ChatGPT-4o; Astronomy education; Visual representations; Moon phases,Creating and evaluating instructional materials with generative artificial intelligence: visual representations in astronomy education,30
"This study aimed to develop and validate the Metacognitions about Generative AI Use Scale (MGAUS) to assess college students’ metacognitive beliefs about generative AI and to explore these metacognitions as predictors of generative AI addiction risk. A total of 1229 college students from China participated in the study, providing data through an online questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis initially determined the MGAUS’s structure, revealing two primary factors: “Positive metacognitions about generative AI use” and “Negative metacognitions about generative AI use”, comprising nine items in total. Confirmatory factor analysis further validated the scale’s stability and fit, as well as tested measurement invariance across gender, age, and educational levels. Correlation analysis indicated significant positive correlations between both positive and negative metacognitions and generative AI addiction. Additionally, negative metacognitions were significantly positively correlated with anxiety, whereas the correlation between positive metacognitions and anxiety was not significant. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that, after controlling for gender, both positive and negative metacognitions remained significant predictors of generative AI addiction, with negative metacognitions demonstrating stronger predictive power. A network analysis of the scale items further illuminated the close relationship between positive and negative metacognitions. Taken together, these findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of metacognition in the context of generative AI use and provide a scientific foundation for the prevention and intervention of generative AI addiction.","Xie, Yuntian; Li, Ying; Yu, Taowen; Liu, Yuxuan",Springer Nature Journals,,10.1007/s10639-025-13584-8,frmx4bqu3z,,,14,Education and Information Technologies: The Official Journal of the IFIP Technical Committee on Education,,20542,20523,,True,20250901,Springer US,Metacognition; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Addiction; Behavior,Metacognitions about generative AI use: psychometric and network analysis among Chinese college students,30
"The adoption of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) in higher education (HE) has led to an urgent need to foster genAI literacy among staff. Thus, we drew on a genAI introductory course for staff at a major university college in Norway to examine, through a one-group pre-/post-test design, if participation was associated with an increased genAI acceptance, i.e. intention to use genAI tools. We posed five hypotheses based on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and the Artificial Intelligence Attitude Scale (AIAS) to explore the predictive relationship between pre- and post-course genAI acceptance, the moderating effects of demographic and experiential variables, and changes in the underlying factors of genAI acceptance over time. Through PLS-SEM we discovered that Habit and AI attitudes were significant predictors of genAI acceptance at the beginning (T1), but that none of the examined variables significantly predicted genAI acceptance at the end of the course (T2). Behavioral intentions at T1 did not significantly predict Behavioral intentions at T2, either. However, the UTAUT2 factors combined with AI attitudes explained 79.5% of the variance in genAI acceptance at T1 and 82.4% at T2. Neither gender, age, experience with genAI, nor teaching position moderated the relationship between genAI acceptance at T1 and T2. Last, but not least we found a significant and large increase in genAI use from T1 to T2. Similarly, all UTAUT2 predictor variables significantly increased while AI attitudes did not. Our study is the first to implement a pre-/post-test design utilizing the UTAUT2 framework among HE staff. Our findings suggest that course participation is associated with changes in prior acceptance and intention patterns, potentially reducing disparities in familiarity and use, thereby facilitating professional development within a collegial community.

"The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping collaboration within organizations, evoking both excitement and concern. As an individual production technology, AI risks fragmenting workflows, isolating workers, and undermining the human-centered collaboration vital for creativity and innovation. However, as a coordination technology, AI holds enormous promise for enhancing collective intelligence. By considering the fundamental processes underlying intelligence in any system—including reasoning, memory, and attention—we can envision ways AI can overcome traditional barriers to effective collaboration to elevate collective intelligence. This paper explores how AI can help clarify team goals and resolve conflicting motives to enhance collective reasoning; provide personalized knowledge assistance, connect complementary expertise, and mitigate biases to augment collective memory; and facilitate attention to priorities and manage asynchronous and synchronous coordination to optimize the use of collective attention. Despite these opportunities, integrating AI into collaboration presents challenges, including potential impacts on trust, cohesion, and ethical concerns. The paper outlines a research agenda to address these challenges and explore AI’s role in fostering inclusive, efficient, and innovative collaboration.

"Educators and designers alike incorporate images in teaching and learning to create shared meaning, and to engage learners. With the growth of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) incorporating images is as easy as typing a quick prompt. Think of an idea, type a prompt, and an image synthesizer can create it. Image synthesizers are genAI programs that can generate an image from a text prompt. With the growth of genAI, a common problem among educators of finding an appropriate or desired image or illustration to support instruction may be solved by utilizing an image synthesizer. Currently, though, the relevance and accuracy of these types of images are relatively unknown. Therefore, a systematic review of AI-generated images was warranted. In this novel study, we conducted a visual content analysis of AI generated images (N = 291) representing STEM-related occupations (e.g., scientist, mathematician). The analysis of these AI-generated images from three AI image generation programs indicated gender bias (21.3%), racial bias (18.9%), eyes disfigurement (17.9%), and hand inaccuracies (22.3%).

"This study explores the potential of visual generative artificial intelligence (visual GenAI) in augmenting city design workflows. Using customized DALL-E 3 interfaces, we facilitated engagement sessions with members of an academic planning community to assess their perceptions of AI-generated imagery before and after its use, with a focus on main street revitalization (n = 24 qualitative, n = 17 quantitative). Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model, we assessed cognitive, operational, and participatory dimensions influencing user attitudes toward AI-assisted urban design. Perceived usefulness in cognitive and participatory tasks emerged as the strongest predictors of attitudes toward visual GenAI use, explaining up to 71% and 44% of the variance, respectively. While participants valued the ability to generate visuals and stimulate dialogue rapidly, challenges with prompt precision, output predictability, and interface usability limited broader accessibility. User expertise moderated perceptions, with higher proficiency participants generally expressing more positive attitudes toward its use. Our preliminary findings suggest that while visual GenAI may offer new opportunities to augment cognitive and co-design processes, its integration into city design workflows may also depend on diverse training datasets to address biases; human-centered design with clearer affordances and support for non-expert users; and, validation processes that maintain human oversight.

"This study investigates Thai K-12 teachers' perceptions of integrating Generative AI (GAI) into educational practices, focusing on its benefits, challenges, and adoption factors. Employing a survey design with a mixed-methods approach, a sample of 416 teachers was surveyed, and thematic analysis of open-ended responses was conducted. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) identified two key dimensions: Advantages, including enhancing teaching efficiency and supporting personalized learning, and Challenges, such as ethical concerns and the impact on critical thinking. Qualitative findings revealed that teachers view GAI as a valuable tool for improving teaching efficiency and engagement while easing workload, but they raised concerns about its potential to undermine critical thinking and highlighted challenges like inadequate infrastructure and the need for ethical guidelines. The EFA model demonstrated good fit indices with RMSEA = .089, SRMR = .023, TLI = .952, and CFI = .975. Quantitative analysis revealed a strong relationship with a large effect size between self-efficacy and GAI adoption (r = .68, p &lt; .001, z = .83).

"Access to domain expertise is critical to problem-solving activities. This study investigates the role and usefulness of an AI-based troubleshooting assistant in the knowledge-intensive context of train commissioning. The authors developed a multilingual, user-centred chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework and a Large Language Model to provide real-time, project-specific troubleshooting support. A controlled field experiment with 19 commissioning technicians completing 173 tasks was conducted to evaluate the effect of the AI assistant. Results show that AI-assisted users significantly outperformed non-users in task performance. The benefits were more substantial among less experienced technicians, which emphasises the prospect of AI assistants in bridging skill gaps. Performance gains were also moderated by the AI attitudes and AI familiarity of technicians, suggesting that organisations should take these factors into account when striving to adopt AI assistants. The findings provide empirical evidence for the role of generative AI in scaling operational knowledge, enhancing worker performance, and improving the efficiency of engineering workflows. This study contributes to the discussion of the role of generative AI in problem-solving by demonstrating a novel application for frontline decision support in complex, high-variance industrial tasks.","Löwhagen, Nils; Schwendener, Philippe; Netland, Torbjørn",Business Source Ultimate,,10.1080/00207543.2025.2527368,fhbzp7skpb,,,,International Journal of Production Research,,22,1,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=fhbzp7skpb&recordId=fhbzp7skpb&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,True,20250704,Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd,Task performance; <mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Problem solving; Workflow management; Industrial applications; Training needs; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>,Can a troubleshooting AI assistant improve task performance in industrial contexts?,
"While generative artificial intelligence (AI) empowers students in their learning, it may also have the potential to undermine their learning agency. Understanding student learning agency in the generative AI-supported contexts (SLA-GAI) has become critical for educators. However, student learning agency is a domain-specific construct, current scales neglect the specific generative AI situations. Therefore, current scales are considered inapplicable for measuring SLA-GAI. This study aims to conceptualize the student learning agency and develop and validate the SLA-GAI scale. We conducted an exploratory sequential design with two stages. In the first stage, a literature review and group interview with experts were conducted to conceptualize the student learning agency and generate initial items. 268 valid samples from university students were then collected and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to adjust the initial items. In the second stage, 425 valid samples were collected and randomly split into two subsamples (n1 = 268, n2 = 245) to conduct EFA and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), respectively. The findings indicate that the SLA-GAI scale includes ten factors with 34 items. Four of these -- self-cognition, goal setting, self-adjustment and self-reflection -- represent the key ability dimension of the SLA-GAI scale. The other three factors -- selective action, responsible action and participative action represent the active action dimension of the SLA-GAI scale. Finally, self-efficacy and volition present the essential mental characteristics of the SLA-GAI scale. The developed SLA-GAI scale can reflect the latest and abundant meaning of the student learning agency in generative AI-supported contexts. It can help educators assess and develop student learning agency in the generative AI-supported contexts and explore related theories.",Liangliang Xia; Kexin Shen; Herui Sun; Xin An; Yan Dong,ERIC,,10.1007/s10639-024-13137-5,7k3nziv5lr,,,10,Education and Information Technologies,,14021,13999,,True,20250701,,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>Intelligence</mark>; Technology Uses in Education; Test Construction; Test Validity; Learning Processes; Measures (Individuals); College Students; Factor Analysis; Student Evaluation,Developing and Validating the Student Learning Agency Scale in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Supported Contexts,30
"The rapid advancement of generative AI technologies is increasingly accompanied by their broader application across various sectors, particularly within creative industries. In this study, IBM Watson BEAT software, based on generative AI technology, was tested as an educational tool in the process of teaching music composition theory to flute students. The Revised Two Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R SPQ 2 F) was employed to investigate predominant learning approaches among study participants. Comparison of pre- and post-test results using the paired and independent samples t-statistics demonstrated significant improvements among students in the experimental group in the deep motive index (increase from 11.74 to 12.86, t = -2.013, p = 0.000) and the surface motive index (decrease from 12.87 to 11.66, t = 2.213, p = 0.002), which correspond to motivational foundations for choosing learning strategies, as well as in the complexity index of the musical compositions created (increase from 3.56 to 4.79, t = -2.146, p = 0.000). However, no significant impact on indices corresponding to practical strategies of learning behavior (deep strategy and surface strategy) was observed, indicating that the duration of the educational intervention may have been insufficient to induce lasting changes in study habits. The obtained results suggest a trend toward a positive influence of generative AI technologies on the formation of students' learning strategies.

"This study explores the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in developing a dynamic framework for assessing tourism carrying capacities in natural destinations, with a specific focus on mountainous and cave areas in Thailand. The proposed framework, termed SAFER (Sustainable Economic Development, Allocating Resources Optimally, Fostering Community Engagement, Enhancing Visitor Satisfaction, and Resource Conservation), integrates GenAI’s advanced capabilities in creating data-driven and adaptive solutions to address the complexities of sustainable tourism management. Unlike traditional AI applications, which emphasize pattern recognition and decision-making, GenAI uniquely enables the creation of predictive and prescriptive tools tailored to specific ecological and cultural contexts. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, involving data collection from 14 pilot sites, stakeholder feedback sessions, and collaborative workshops. These methodologies were critical in refining the SAFER framework and identifying its usability and scalability for diverse tourism settings. By leveraging GenAI’s ability to analyze and generate content dynamically, the framework offers innovative strategies to balance tourism growth with environmental conservation and community welfare. Results highlight the SAFER framework’s applicability in managing tourism’s carrying capacity in sensitive ecosystems, demonstrating how GenAI enhances decision-making processes and visitor management strategies. While the focus of this research is on mountainous and cave regions due to their ecological significance and pressing conservation challenges, the SAFER framework can be adapted to other natural and cultural settings.This study contributes to sustainable tourism research by introducing an adaptable framework that aligns technological innovation with conservation principles, promoting long-term ecological and social well-being.

"Traditional assessment methods struggle to authentically capture the practical application of competencies in complex learning environments such as SEL (Social-Emotional Learning) and CTE (Career and Technical Education). These fields require tools that go beyond self-reports or structured written assessments, which often miss the nuanced, context-driven ways students demonstrate skills. ZoneSight leverages generative AI to perform deep contextual analysis on unstructured data like audio and video, allowing for a richer, more flexible assessment of competencies that more closely reflect the authentic learning, while also introducing more objectivity and scalability to assessments in these fields. This paper presents early progress and preliminary results from ZoneSight, a tool designed to address this challenge by analyzing real interactions to extract insights into nuanced competencies, beginning with SEL. ZoneSight's scalable, psychometrically sound assessments align with the dynamic nature of SEL (current focus) and hold future potential for application in CTE environments.","Halwani, Gus F.; Baird, Miles; Selles, David",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016420,ms6sra7ggb,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,3,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; Engineering profession; Scalability; Educational technology; Engineering education; competency assessment; social-emotional learning; skills-based assessment; scalable assessment; psychometric validity; educational technology,ZoneSight: Generative AI for Assessing Practical Competency in Project-Based and Apprenticeship Learning Environments,

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to have a profound influence on businesses across all sectors. Specifically, generative AI is set to underpin the development of potent and novel capabilities, ushering in a new wave of innovation. For example, ChatGPT has seen massive hype surrounding its launch, with growing speculation regarding its disruptive nature for organizations and society. The ongoing debate argues that ChatGPT will lead to far-reaching innovation. However, it is less clear whether such innovation can be managed. We seek to close this gap by identifying distinctive innovation strategies in terms of two key dimensions: automation and augmentation (high or low). This results in a typology of four generic innovation strategies: Traditional Tool (low automation, low augmentation), Basic Automation (high automation, low augmentation), Automated Assistance (low automation, high augmentation), and Assisted Augmentation (high automation, high augmentation). The strategies and typology essentially differ in relation to automation and augmentation for innovation, risks, and challenges faced in the process, and available tactics for managing the process. Building upon this framework, our insights suggest that practitioners can harness ChatGPT effectively by aligning their innovation objectives with the appropriate strategy, whether it be enhancing creative processes or streamlining operational efficiency, thereby navigating the complexities of innovation with a more structured and strategic approach.","Holmström, Jonny; Carroll, Noel",OpenAIRE,,10.1016/j.bushor.2024.02.010,zxuqy2lghv,,,,Business Horizons,,573,559,,False,20250901,Elsevier BV,<mark>Artificial</mark> <mark>intelligence</mark>; Automation; ChatGPT; Prompt engineering; Augmentation; Innovation; Business Administration; Företagsekonomi,How organizations can innovate with generative AI,68
"In engineering education, stakeholder engagement plays a critical role in developing solutions that meet both technical and user-centred requirements. During the 2023/24 academic year, GenAl, specifically ChatGPT, was integrated into an MSc team-based project module to simulate stakeholder involvement. This approach allowed students to explore stakeholder dynamics by using AI to identify relevant stakeholders, generate questions for consultation, and simulate interactions. These AI-driven simulations enhanced students' understanding of stakeholder needs and decision-making processes. However, students' engagement was initially hampered by a lack of prompt engineering skills, which limited their ability to effectively communicate with the AI and extract meaningful responses. This underscores the importance of incorporating GenAl prompt engineering in training engineers of the future. To address this challenge, students were given predefined prompts to guide their GenAl interactions, helping them refine questions for better stakeholder insights. Despite these initial challenges, the use of GenAl helped students appreciate the complexities of real-world engineering problems and fostered a deeper understanding of how to balance diverse stakeholder needs. Preliminary results suggest the need for prompt engineering training and that incorporating GenAl into engineering education can significantly enhance students' ability to critically evaluate and integrate feedback into their designs. Future research will explore incorporating human stakeholder engagement methods, alongside prompt engineering training, to further enhance learning outcomes and compare the impact of AI versus human involvement. This work contributes to ongoing discussions on the role of GenAl in education.","Offor, Kennedy John",IEEE Xplore Digital Library,,10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016557,oeu5bn3p6j,,,,"2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), 2025 IEEE",,3,1,,True,20250422,IEEE,Bioengineering; Computing and Processing; Engineering Profession; General Topics for Engineers; Robotics and Control Systems; Signal Processing and Analysis; Training; Decision making; Chatbots; Complexity theory; Stakeholders; Prompt engineering; Engineering education; <mark>Generative</mark> <mark>AI</mark>; GenAI; engineering design process; stakeholder engagement; engineering education (key words),Leveraging Generative AI to Simulate Stakeholder Involvement in the Engineering Design Process: A Case Study of MSc Team-Based Projects,

"As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) continues to reshape numerous sectors, the ethical implications of its deployment have become a critical area of society. This study employs a topic modeling technique to systematically analyze a large corpus of peer-reviewed literature related to ethics in GenAI, aiming to uncover prevailing themes and conceptual patterns. Using a natural language processing method, the analysis identified ten distinct topics that were subsequently synthesized into six overarching macrotopics related to ethics in GenAI: (1) education and learning, (2) bias, frameworks, and legal compliance, (3) cybersecurity, governance, and risks, (4) social impact and sustainability, (5) digital transformation and emerging tech, and (6) academic research and writing. Each macrotopic is examined through the lens of existing scholarly literature, providing an overview of current debates in the area. The findings demonstrate the pressing need for comprehensive governance frameworks that prioritize transparency, fairness, and accountability in the development and deployment of GenAI systems. The relevance of the emerging macrotopics extends beyond technical or policy considerations, situating them within broader ethical discourse around language, communication, and media technologies, where questions of authorship, representation, and discursive power are increasingly mediated by GenAI.
