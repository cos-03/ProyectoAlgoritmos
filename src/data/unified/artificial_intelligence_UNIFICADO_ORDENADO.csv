,"Artificial Intelligence : Ethical, Social, and Security Impacts for the Present and the Future","A global perspective on AI AI is much more than just a simple tool powering our smartphones or allowing us to ask Alexa about the latest cinema times. It is a technology that is, in very subtle but unmistakable ways, exerting an ever-increasing influence over our lives – and the more we use it, the more AI is altering our existence. The rise of AI and super-intelligent AI raises ethical issues. AI is the power behind Google's search engine, enables social media sites to serve up targeted advertising, and gives Alexa and Siri their voices. It is also the technology enabling self-driving vehicles, predictive policing, and autonomous weapons that have the ability to kill without direct human intervention. All of these bring up complex ethical issues that are still unresolved and will continue to be the subject of ongoing debate. There are untold how-to books on AI technology, replete with methods to improve and advance the statistics and algorithms of AI; however, the social, ethical and security impacts are often at best a secondary consideration – if discussed at all. This book explores the complex topic of AI ethics in a cross-functional way, alternating between theory and practice. Practical and recent events, and their associated challenges, are presented, such as the collateral effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the application of AI technologies. The book also gives an up-to-date overview of the potential positive and negative outcomes of AI implementations together with an analysis of AI from an ethical perspective. Before you dive into a world populated with AI, read this book to understand the associated ethical challenges of AI technologies",Julie Mehan,,,20220101,,,ITGP,,,,,COMPUTERS / <mark>Artificial Intelligence</mark> / General; LAW / Communications; LAW / Criminal Law / General; LAW / Computer &amp; Internet; Data protection--Technological innovations; <mark>Artificial intelligence</mark>--Moral and ethical aspects; <mark>Artificial intelligence</mark>--Social aspects,,,,False,,ebsco,3@ebsco

,"Artificial Intelligence : Reflections in Philosophy, Theology, and the Social Sciences","This book discusses major issues of the current AI debate from the perspectives of philosophy, theology, and the social sciences: Can AI have a consciousness? Is superintelligence possible and probable? How does AI change individual and social life? Can there be artificial persons? What influence does AI have on religious worldviews? In Western societies, we are surrounded by artificially intelligent systems. Most of these systems are embedded in online platforms. But embodiments of AI, be it by voice or by actual physical embodiment, give artificially intelligent systems another dimension in terms of their impact on how we perceive these systems, how they shape our communication with them and with fellow humans and how we live and work together. AI in any form gives a new twist to the big questions that humanity has concerned herself with for centuries: What is consciousness? How should we treat each other - what is right and what is wrong? How do our creations change the world we are living in? Which challenges do we have to face in the future?",Benedikt Paul Goecke; Astrid Marieke Rosenthal-von der Pütten,,,20200101,,,Brill | mentis,,,,,PHILOSOPHY / Mind &amp; Body; <mark>Artificial intelligence</mark>--Philosophy; <mark>Artificial intelligence</mark>; <mark>Artificial intelligence</mark>--Moral and ethical aspects,,,,False,,ebsco,7@ebsco
,"Artificial Intelligence: Advances, Ethics and Strategies","The field of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, and one of the most exciting developments in recent years has been the emergence of generative models. These models have shown the ability to produce human-like language and even generate images, videos, and music. While the potential applications of generative models are vast and impressive, there are also serious concerns about the ethical implications of their use. As the potential of AI and generative models is explored, it is essential to consider the impact they may have on society. AI must be used in a way that is ethical, transparent, and beneficial to all of society. This will require collaboration between government, industry, and academia to ensure that the AI developed is reliable, trustworthy, and aligned with public policy goals.",James M.

,"Artificial Intelligence: Background, Risks and Policies","The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has gone through multiple waves of advancement over the decades. Today, AI can broadly be thought of as computerized systems that work and react in ways commonly thought to require intelligence, such as the ability to learn, solve problems, and achieve goals under uncertain and varying conditions. The field encompasses a range of methodologies and application areas, including machine learning (ML), natural language processing, and robotics. AI holds potential benefits and opportunities, but also challenges and pitfalls. For example, AI technologies can accelerate and provide insights into data processing; augment human decision-making; optimize performance for complex tasks and systems; and improve safety for people in dangerous occupations. On the other hand, AI systems may perpetuate or amplify bias, may not yet be fully able to explain their decision-making, and often depend on vast datasets that are not widely accessible to facilitate research and development (R&amp;D). Further, stakeholders have questioned the adequacy of human capital in both the public and private sectors to develop and work with AI, as well as the adequacy of current laws and regulations for dealing with societal and ethical issues that may arise. Together, such challenges can lead to an inability to fully assess and understand the operations and outputs of AI systems.",Gary Dalton,"Computer Science, Technology and Applications",,20240101,,,SNOVA,,,,,COMPUTERS / <mark>Artificial Intelligence</mark> / General; <mark>Artificial intelligence</mark>,,,,False,,ebsco,2@ebsco

,Lower Artificial Intelligence Literacy Predicts Greater AI Receptivity.,"As artificial intelligence (AI) transforms society, understanding factors that influence AI receptivity is increasingly important. The current research investigates which types of consumers have greater AI receptivity. Contrary to expectations revealed in four surveys, cross-country data and six additional studies find that people with lower AI literacy are typically more receptive to AI. This lower literacy–greater receptivity link is not explained by differences in perceptions of AI's capability, ethicality, or feared impact on humanity. Instead, this link occurs because people with lower AI literacy are more likely to perceive AI as magical and experience feelings of awe in the face of AI's execution of tasks that seem to require uniquely human attributes. In line with this theorizing, the lower literacy–higher receptivity link is mediated by perceptions of AI as magical and is moderated among tasks not assumed to require distinctly human attributes. These findings suggest that companies may benefit from shifting their marketing efforts and product development toward consumers with lower AI literacy. In addition, efforts to demystify AI may inadvertently reduce its appeal.","Tully, Stephanie M.; Longoni, Chiara; Appel, Gil",Journal of Marketing,,20250901,10.1177/00222429251314491,,American Marketing Association,89.0,5.0,1.0,20.0,<mark>Artificial intelligence</mark>; Algorithms; Human-computer interaction; Innovation adoption; Digital literacy; Information literacy; Human-<mark>artificial intelligence</mark> interaction; Awe,/linkprocessor/v2-pdf?sourceRecordId=q6shskx2of&recordId=q6shskx2of&profileIdentifier=q46rpe&intent=view&type=pdfLink&lang=es,,,True,,ebsco,9@ebsco
